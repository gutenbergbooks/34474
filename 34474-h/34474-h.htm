<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>In presenting this story for the young the writer has endeavored
to give a vivid and accurate life of Jeanne D&#8217;Arc
(Joan of Arc) as simply told as possible. There has been no
pretence toward keeping to the speech of the Fifteenth Century,
which is too archaic to be rendered literally for young
readers, although for the most part the words of the Maid
have been given verbatim.</p>
<p>The name of this wonderful girl has been variously written.
In the Fifteenth Century the name of the beloved disciple was
preferred for children above all others; so we find numerous
Jeans and Jeannes. To render these holy names more in keeping
with the helplessness of little ones the diminutive forms of
Jeannot and Jeannette were given them. So this girl was
named Jeannette, or Jehannette in the old spelling, and so she
was called in her native village. By her own account this was
changed to Jeanne when she came into France. The English
translation of Jeanne D&#8217;Arc is Joan of Arc; more properly
it should be Joanna. Because it seems more beautiful to her
than the others the writer has retained the name of Jeanne
in her narrative.</p>
<p>It is a mooted question which form of the name of Jeanne&#8217;s
father is correct: D&#8217;Arc or Darc. It is the writer&#8217;s belief
that D&#8217;Arc was the original writing, when it would follow that
Jacques D&#8217;Arc would be James of the Bow or James Bowman,
as he would have been called had he been an English peasant.
For this reason the Maid&#8217;s surname has been given as D&#8217;Arc;
though there are many who claim that Darc is the nearest the
truth.</p>

the fruit of whose labours the writer has entered: M. Jules

Arc, the Maid,&#8221; and many others.</p>
<p>The thanks of the writer are also due to the librarians of New
York City, Albany and Glens Falls who kindly aided her in
obtaining books and information. Thanks are also due to the
Rev. Matthew Fortier, S. J., Dean of Fordham University,
New York City, for information upon a point for which search
had been vainly made.</p>
<p>That this book may make a little niche for itself among other
books upon the most marvellous girl the world has ever known,
is the wish of</p>

<p>&#8220;Who-oo-ee!&#8221; The gleeful shout came from
the lips of a little girl who stood, with her hands
cupped about her lips, on the edge of a streamlet
which divided the village of Domremy into two parts.</p>
<p>She was a slight little maiden, of some twelve summers, and
as she gave the call she danced about in the warm sunshine
as though unable to keep still from the mere joy of being.
Her hair was very dark and very abundant. Her eyes were
wonderful for their blueness and the steadfastness of their
gaze. Her face, though comely, was remarkable not so much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
for its beauty as for the happiness of its expression. She stood
still listening for a moment after sending forth her call, and
then, as the Sabbath quiet remained unbroken, she sent forth
the cry again in a clear, sweet voice that penetrated into the
farthest reaches of the village:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who-oo-ee!&#8221;</p>
<p>This time the shout was caught up instantly, and answered
by many voices. The village wakened suddenly into life, as
there poured forth from the cottages a goodly number of boys
and girls who came running toward the little maid eagerly.
She shook a finger at them reprovingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but you are late,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Here it is ten of the
clock, and we were to start at nine. The day will be half gone
before we get to the Tree. I was afraid that you had gone off
without me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone without you, Jeanne D&#8217;Arc,&#8221; exclaimed one of the
girls. &#8220;Why, we couldn&#8217;t have any sport without you. I had
to wait for my mother to fix my basket&ndash;&ndash;that is the reason that
I was late.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I! And I!&#8221; chimed several other children in a chorus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you pack them yourselves?&#8221; demanded Jeanne,
who seemed to be a leader among them. &#8220;I did mine, and
Jean&#8217;s and Pierrelot&#8217;s too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where are the boys?&#8221; asked a lad. &#8220;They are not
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They ran back to get more nuts,&#8221; answered the little girl.
&#8220;Jean said that we must be sure to have plenty. There!
They are coming now. Let&#8217;s get into line, and be ready to
start as soon as they get here.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>Gleefully the children formed a line, and then took up their
march toward the great wood which stretched in primeval
abundance half a league to the westward of Domremy.</p>
<p>In all France there was not a more delicate, tranquil landscape
than that of this broad valley of the Meuse, which extended
in unbroken reaches between low hills, softly undulating,
crowned with oaks, maples and birches. The trees were
leafless now, and there were still ridges of snow to be seen among
the hills, but already there were monitions of Spring in the
air. The buds were swelling, springing grass carpeted the
fields, and there was no longer ice in the river, which rippled
its apple-green waters in the sunshine.</p>
<p>Along the valley the banks of the Meuse were dotted with
many hamlets, villages and towns, and among them was Domremy,
which nestled upon its western side in the county of
Champagne. It was the greyest of the grey hamlets in this
borderland. It consisted of a castle, a monastery, and a score
of cottages which were grouped about a small church, but it was
well favoured by Nature in that the meadow lands which lay
around it were rich and fertile beyond those of most villages,
and the vineyards which covered the southern slopes of the
hills were famous all over the countryside.</p>
<p>It was the first fine day of March, 1424, and &#8220;Laetare
Sunday.&#8221; &#8220;Laetare Sunday&#8221; the fourth Sunday in Lent was
called, because during the mass of the day was chanted the
passage beginning, &#8220;Laetare, Jerusalem&#8221;; but the children
called it &#8220;The Day of the Fountains,&#8221; for upon this day the
annual &#8220;Well Dressing&#8221; of the Spring which lay at the edge
of the forest was observed, and the Fairy Tree was decorated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
In short, upon this day the children of the valley held high
festival.</p>
<p>So, merrily they marched toward the wood; the boys carrying
baskets of lunch, for they were to picnic, and the girls bearing
garlands that were to be used for the decoration. It was a
joyous party, for it was Spring; and all young things rejoice
in Spring. There was a sweetness of leaf mold in the air that
came to the senses with the penetrating quality of incense. A
tender mist lay on the hills, and over all spread the radiant sky.
The happy children laughed, and sang, and jested as they
went, for the mild air animated them with a gentle intoxication.</p>
<p>And the little maid called Jeanne D&#8217;Arc was the blithest of
them all. Hither and thither she darted, lightly as thistle
down, seeming literally to bubble over with happiness. All at
once she stooped, and plucked a long blade of grass, holding it
up for inspection.</p>
<p>&#8220;See, Mengette,&#8221; she cried addressing a girl near her.
&#8220;How long the grass is! And how warm the sun is! Oh, is
not God good to give us so fine day for our pleasure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is good; yes,&#8221; assented the girl addressed as Mengette.
Then as the little maid darted away she turned to the girl by
her side: &#8220;Jeanne is so religious,&#8221; she commented with a shrug
of her shoulders. &#8220;She cannot even play without speaking of
God. I wish that she were not so good. And you wish it too,
do you not, Hauviette?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish that Jeanne D&#8217;Arc would not be so good?&#8221; exclaimed
Hauviette, who was a staunch friend of Jeanne&#8217;s. &#8220;Why, she
would not be Jeanne D&#8217;Arc if she were not good.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I do not mean for her not to be good exactly,&#8221; demurred
the first girl. &#8220;I meant that I wished she were not so pious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mengette, if the Cur&eacute; should hear you,&#8221; breathed the second
girl in shocked tones. &#8220;He would make you say many Ave
Maries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who is to tell him what I say?&#8221; demanded Mengette,
an expression of anxiety flitting across her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I, Mengette, but I fear some of the others hearing
such words may speak of them to the good Cur&eacute;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the others speak as I do,&#8221; protested Mengette.
&#8220;There is not one of them who does not think that Jeanne
D&#8217;Arc is too pious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Attend,&#8221; cried one of the lads at this moment using the
peasant&#8217;s expression to attract attention. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see who shall
be first to reach the tree. He who does so shall hang the first
wreath.&#8221;</p>
<p>A gleeful shout went up at the words, and there followed
a quick dash for the tree, which began before the speaker had
made an end of what he was saying. Among the others
Jeanne D&#8217;Arc threw up her head, laughing merrily, and darted
forward. So fleet and light of foot was she that she soon
distanced her companions. Easily could she have gained the
goal had there not come a cry from Mengette, who at this instant
stumbled and fell prone upon the grass. Like a flash
Jeanne turned, and, seeing that Mengette had risen, and was
standing bent over as though in pain, ran back to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you hurt, Mengette?&#8221; she asked anxiously. &#8220;&#8217;Tis pity
that you fell. Where is the pain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In my knee,&#8221; sobbed Mengette. &#8220;And now I shall have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
to lag behind; for walk fast I cannot. Do you run on,
Jeanne. You were like to win the race, so fleet of foot were
you. In truth, it seemed as though you were flying. Myself,
I will reach the tree when I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nenni,&#8221; replied Jeanne, using the strong peasant negative.
&#8220;I will walk with you. &#8217;Tis not far now, but the way would
seem long to you should you traverse it alone when in pain.
There! lean on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a sigh of relief that she was not to be left by herself
Mengette leaned heavily on the arm of her friend, though the
latter was younger and smaller than she. She thought naught
of this. It seemed natural to her playmates to lean upon
Jeanne D&#8217;Arc. So, slowly, with much groaning on Mengette&#8217;s
part, the two friends came presently to the Fairy Tree, where
the rest of the party were already assembled.</p>
<p>On the border of the Bois Chesnu (the woods of oaks), stood
an ancient beech tree overhanging the highroad. &#8220;In Spring,&#8221;
said the peasants of the valley, &#8220;the tree is as fair as lily flowers,
the leaves and branches sweep the ground.&#8221; It had many
names, but was usually spoken of as <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''l'Arbre-des-Fees'' in original text">l&#8217;Arbre-des-F&eacute;es</ins>. Once
upon a time, when the lords and ladies of Bourlemont dwelt
at the castle which stood before the village, it had been called
&#8220;The Ladies&#8217; Tree.&#8221; For then the high born dames and their
cavaliers feasted and danced about it with each renewal of
Spring. But the castle had long been deserted, so the children
had come to claim the tree for their own.</p>
<p> They called it The Fairy Tree, because it was believed that
in the olden time the fairies used it for a trysting place. So
now, with bursts of song and laughter, the girls hung their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
garlands upon its ancient branches, then joining hands the
lads and the lassies formed a ring, and circled around the tree,
singing gayly.</p>
<p>It was a pretty sight: pastoral and innocent,&ndash;&ndash;one that
would have delighted the heart of a Corot. The singing
children dancing about the tree, the red homespun frocks of
the girls and the blue smocks of the boys making pleasing bits
of color against the dark forest stretching behind them, and
the distant village nestled on the banks of the apple-green river.
Perhaps the festival was a survival of paganism; perchance a
remnant of the tree worship of the ancient Celts interwoven
with a traditional holiday; but the Church recognized it. On
Ascension Eve the priest came there, and chanted the Gospel
of Saint John to exorcise the spirits, so that neither fairies nor
anything evil could harm the little ones of his flock.</p>
<p>After the ceremony of hanging the wreaths was completed
a cloth was spread upon the grass, and the contents of the lunch
baskets placed thereon. There were nuts, hard boiled eggs,
and little rolls of a curious form, which the housewives had
kneaded on purpose. In the midst of the preparations there
came the clamor of bells drifting from the linked villages of
Domremy and Greux, chiming the midday angelus.</p>
<p>Instantly little Jeanne, who was among the girls busied
about the lunch arose and, turning toward the church of her
own village, joined her palms, bending her forehead to them.
Mengette, who had taken no part in getting the lunch ready
because of her lamed knee, and who sat in the shade of the beech
upon the grass, leaned over and poked Pierre, one of Jeanne&#8217;s
brothers, in the side.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Do as your sister does, Pierrelot,&#8221; she cried, pointing toward
the reverent little maiden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Myself, I am not so devout,&#8221; he made answer. &#8220;Neither
Jean, Jacquemin, nor I feel as Jeanne does, but such things
are to her liking. My mother grieves that I am so slack in
the matter. But Jeanne loves the church. She is a good
sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a good friend also, Pierrelot,&#8221; nodded the girl emphatically,
remembering how Jeanne had come back to her
while the rest of the party had gone on. &#8220;She might have
been first at the tree, and so have won the right to hang her
wreath first. Instead, she came back to help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne,&#8221; called Hauviette suddenly, as the angelus ceased
to chime, and the devout little maid turned again toward her
companions, &#8220;do you not wish that we could have our &#8216;Well
dressing&#8217; upon Thursday instead of &#8216;Laetare Sunday&#8217;? &#8217;Tis
said that then the fairies hold their tryst.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pouf!&#8221; ejaculated Pierre, or Pierrelot, as he was usually
called. &#8220;You would not find them an you did come. There
are no fairies now. My godfather Jean says that there have
been no fairies at Domremy for twenty or thirty years. So
what would be the use of coming here Thursday?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But my godmother says that one of the lords of the castle
became a fairy&#8217;s knight, and kept his tryst with her here under
this very tree at eventide; so there must be fairies,&#8221; spoke
Hauviette with timid persistency. &#8220;What do you think,
Jeanne?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They come no more,&#8221; replied the little maid gravely.
&#8220;Godmother Beatrix and the Cur&eacute; both say that they do not.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
They came in the olden time, but for their sins they come no
longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perchance they hold their meetings further back in the
wood,&#8221; suggested another girl. &#8220;That may be the reason
that they are not seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall see,&#8221; cried one of the boys rising, and starting
toward the forest that extended its dark reaches behind them.
&#8220;If there be fairies there, I, Colin, shall find them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not go, Colin,&#8221; exclaimed Jeanne in alarm. &#8220;You know
that there is danger both from wolves and wild boars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Few dared enter the wood, so thick it was, and the wolves
it harbored were the terror of the countryside. So greatly
were they feared, and such was the desire to be rid of the
menace, that there was a reward given by the mayors of the
villages for every head of a wolf, or a wolf cub, brought to
them. So now a protesting chorus arose from the children as
Colin, with a scornful &#8220;Pouf!&#8221; threw his shoulders back, and
swaggered into the wood.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis time for the &#8216;Well dressing,&#8217;&#8221; declared Jean, another
one of Jeanne&#8217;s brothers. &#8220;Let Colin look for the fairies if
he will. Let us go to the Spring. &#8217;Tis what we came for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so say I,&#8221; chimed in another boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I. And I,&#8221; came from others. As this seemed to
be the desire of all there was an immediate stir and bustle.
The remnants of the lunch were hastily gathered up, and put
in baskets; some of the wreaths were taken from the tree,
and then the line of march was formed. Just as they were
ready to start, however, there came a shrill shout from the
forest:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></div>
<p>&#8220;A wolf! A wolf!&#8221; cried the voice of Colin. &#8220;Help!
Help!&#8221;</p>
<p>Stock still stood the frightened children. Again the cry
came. At once there was a stir in the line, and a babel of
excited voices broke forth as Jeanne D&#8217;Arc was seen running
pell-mell into the forest in the direction from which the voice
of her playmate came.</p>
<p>Colin was standing in the midst of a blackthorn thicket
when she reached him. There was no sign of wolf, or animal
of any kind, and he burst into a peal of laughter as the little
girl glanced about in amazement. As the sound of his mirth
reached the waiting children they too, knowing from it that
naught was amiss, ran into the wood. The mischievous boy
doubled up, and rocked to and fro in glee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but you were well fooled,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Look at Jeanne&#8217;s
face. You were afraid. All but her, and what could she have
done to help me an there had been a wolf?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She could have done all that you deserve to have done,
Colin,&#8221; retorted Pierre, who was a manly little lad. &#8220;Shame
upon you for crying out when there was naught to cry for.
&#8217;Twould serve you right should a real wolf set upon you. Your
mother shall know how you sought to frighten us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas but in sport,&#8221; muttered Colin, somewhat crestfallen.
He had thought that the jest would be treated as great fun,
and now here they stood regarding him reproachfully.
&#8220;&#8217;Twas but in sport,&#8221; he said again, but there was no answering
smile on any of the faces around him. The matter was of
too serious a nature to admit of jesting.</p>

THE GOOSEBERRY SPRING<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>For a brief time only did the children stand about the boy,
and then with one accord, though no word was spoken, they
formed their line again, and started for the Spring. Colin
followed after shamedfacedly.</p>
<p>At first the march was a silent one, for the incident had
thrown a damper upon their spirits, but soon it was forgotten,
and once more their voices rose in song and mirth. The boys
and girls who were at the head of the party went rapidly,
and suddenly caught sight of a streamlet of pure water springing
from a wooded hole in a wooded hill, by the side of a
wooden bench which formed a resting place about the middle
of the slope. The streamlet at first spread into a basin which
it had excavated for itself; and then, falling in a small cascade,
flowed across the path where a carpet of cress had grown, and
disappeared in the reeds and grasses. All about the margin
of the Spring were gooseberry bushes intertwining their
branches of greyish green, and these gave it the name of Gooseberry
Spring.</p>
<p>It was believed that the water had miraculous healing powers,
so the children in turn knelt by the side of the basin, and drank
deeply of the limpid water. For one drink from this wonderful
Spring, it was said, was an insurance against fever for a
whole year. The garlands which had been carried from the
Fairy Tree were now spread around the &#8220;Well,&#8221; a ring was
formed, and the children danced and sang as they had done
about the tree. The sun was setting before the games were
ended, and the rustic festival was over. Then, tired but happy,
the little folk set their faces toward home.</p>
<p>On the outskirts of the village Jeanne and her brothers met
Jacques D&#8217;Arc, their father, who was driving his flocks and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
herds from the commune for the night. He was a peasant of
sturdy appearance, an upright man, unusually strict and careful
of the behaviour of his children. Jeanne&#8217;s firm chin and
wistful mouth were inherited from this parent. Now as they
ran to help him in his task he greeted them briefly:</p>
<p>&#8220;There is company,&#8221; he told them. &#8220;Your Gossip<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> Beatrix
has come, Jeanne, and two soldiers of France who have escaped
from the Burgundians. By our Lady, this being upon the
highroad has its drawbacks! &#8217;Tis getting so that no day passes
without some wayfarer stopping for bite and bed. The house
is overrun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you like it, father,&#8221; reminded Jeanne, slipping her
hand into his. &#8220;For do not the wayfarers bring you news of
all that happens beyond the mountains?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is well enough,&#8221; admitted Jacques grumblingly.
&#8220;But even so, no man likes his house always full. There! let
the matter rest. We must hasten with the cattle. The night
grows apace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And mother will have need of me to help her,&#8221; cried Jeanne,
quickening her steps. &#8220;With so much company there will be
much work to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>The house where Jeanne D&#8217;Arc lived was a stone cottage
with the roof sloping from a height on one side
half way to the ground on the other. In front there
were but two windows, admitting but a scanty light. Close by
the door, as was usual in that country, were piles of faggots
and farm tools covered with mud and rust. The enclosure
served also as kitchen garden and orchard.</p>
<p>Beyond the cottage, scarce a stone&#8217;s throw distant, only separated
from it by a small graveyard, stood the village church,
and north of both buildings there was a square towered monastery.</p>
<p>A streamlet that flowed down into the Meuse trickled noisily
by the cottage and church, dividing them from the other houses
of the village. Perhaps it was because of this fact that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
church seemed to Jeanne to belong more to her and to her
family than it did to the other inhabitants of Domremy. Born
under its very walls, she was lulled in her cradle by the chime
of its bells, and cherished a passionate love for them in her heart.
Involuntarily the little girl paused with her hand on the latch
to cast a lingering, tender glance at the church before opening
the door of the cottage. Before she had crossed the threshold
a tall woman, who was stirring the contents of a large iron
pot which hung on a tripod before the fire, turned quickly
at the sound of her sabots, and seeing that it was Jeanne hastily
left her task and drew the maid once more without the door.
It was Isabeau Rom&eacute;e,<a name='FNanchor_0002' id='FNanchor_0002'></a><a href='#Footnote_0002' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> the wife of Jacques D&#8217;Arc. In marriage
the wife always retained her maiden name, so Jeanne&#8217;s
mother was always spoken of as Isabeau Rom&eacute;e of Vauthon,
her native village. She was mild in manner, but her usual
serenity was at this moment disturbed by anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right glad am I that you have come, Jeanne,&#8221; she remarked.
&#8220;Your Gossip Beatrix has been asking for you.
She came this afternoon. And but a short time since two <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''men at arms'' in original text">men-at-arms</ins>
came, asking for supper and bed. Gentles they are,
who have but escaped from the hands of the Burgundians, having
been prisoners for many months. Sup them I will right
gladly, but bed them I can not. The house is full. It galls
your father that we must refuse them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why not bed them, mother? Let little Catherine sleep
with you, and I can lie upon the floor before the hearth. Then
the gentles may have my bed.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But you are wearied from your play, my little one, and
to-morrow we go to the river to wash the clothes. You will
need a good rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fear not, mother; I shall sleep well,&#8221; answered Jeanne
cheerily. &#8220;If the poor men have but escaped from prison perchance
they have had naught but the cold stones of a dungeon
to lie upon. Do let it be as I say, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As you will then, my little one. In truth it would have
grieved me sorely to refuse the bed, but I knew not what to do.
You have a good heart, child. Go now, and carry in more
faggots for the fire. The night grows chill, though the day
was so warm. A bundle will not be too much for the chimney.
Then bring forth the drinking cups and the knife for cutting
the bread and put them upon the table. I will go to the oven
for another loaf.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The dear child,&#8221; mused the mother as Jeanne obediently
gathered up a large bundle of the faggots and turned toward
the cottage. &#8220;The dear child! Ever ready is she to give up
her own comfort for that of others. May our Lady watch
over her!&#8221;</p>
<p>Meantime Jeanne had hastened into the house, and had
thrown her bundle of faggots into the great chimney, over
which hung a white stone mantel shaped somewhat like a pent
house. On one side of the hearth flags sat an elderly woman
who was amusing Jeanne&#8217;s sister, Catherine, a child a few
years younger than she. Jeanne returned the woman&#8217;s warm
greeting affectionately, then drew the deal table before the
hearth, glancing as she did so at the two men who sat at the
far end of the hearth flags.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>One was a man of thirty-five or so; the other looked to be
ten years his junior. That they were well born was apparent
from their bearing and manner, but their armour and clothing
were in sad condition. Their hucques<a name='FNanchor_0003' id='FNanchor_0003'></a><a href='#Footnote_0003' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> were in tatters, and only
the closest inspection revealed that they had been of velvet.
They wore no helmets, and many plates were missing from their
rusty armour, leaving their bodies fair marks for arrows or
cross bolts. Noting all this Jeanne was startled to observe
that from the right arm of the younger knight a tiny stream
of blood trickled through the steel sleeve. She was a timid
girl with strangers, therefore it was a full minute before she
could muster courage to approach the young man.</p>
<p>&#8220;You bleed, messire,&#8221; she said, touching him shyly on the
shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? What?&#8221; The young man started quickly, for he
had been dozing in his chair. &#8220;Oh! The wound?&#8221; following
her glance at his arm. &#8220;&#8217;Tis naught. The scratch has but
broken out anew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It should be dressed,&#8221; asserted the little girl with concern.
&#8220;I like not to see French blood flow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She speaks truth, Bertrand,&#8221; interjected the older man.
&#8220;A green wound tingles and burns, and there may be many a
fray before us ere we behold Ch&acirc;lons. Here! I will be your
squire for the nonce, and unbuckle your armour. &#8217;Tis a good
little maid!&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man addressed as Bertrand rose, and let his friend
assist him to remove his armour, protesting against the need
of it as he did so. Jeanne meantime brought a basin of water,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
and when the knight had pushed back the sleeve of his doublet
she washed the blood from the wound gently. Then, with all
the deftness that Isabeau had taught her&ndash;&ndash;for many were the
wounded who had experienced their services&ndash;&ndash;she applied a
compress of oil, and bandaged the arm with bands of serge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you, my little maid,&#8221; spoke the young man gratefully.
&#8220;It does in truth feel better, and though but a scratch,
was indeed painful. What is your name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne, messire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will remember it, Jeanne. Who taught you to be so deft
in such matters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother, messire.&#8221; Jeanne blushed at being so interrogated.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a gentle touch. If my arm does not heal quickly
under such ministration it does not belong to Bertrand de
Poulengy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne blushed again and withdrew quickly, carrying the
basin with her. After placing a tall flagon, the wooden drinking
cups, and the knife for cutting the bread upon the table
she went to her godmother&#8217;s side, and sat down.</p>
<p>As she did so her father and mother entered. Upon her
arm Isabeau carried a large ring of black bread, while Jacques
brought another armful of faggots. They were a hard working,
devout couple who strove to bring up their children,&ndash;&ndash;of
which there were five: three sons, Jacquemin, Jean, and Pierre;
and two daughters, Jeanne and Catherine,&ndash;&ndash;to love work and
religion. Jacques D&#8217;Arc was a doyen; that is, a village elder;
the chief man in Domremy after the mayor. He was of such
substance that he was enabled to raise his family in comfort, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
to give alms and hospitality to the poor wandering friars, and
other needy wayfarers then so common in the land.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit up, messires,&#8221; cried Jacques as his wife emptied the
contents of the iron pot into a platter which she set on the
table. &#8220;Eat, for you must be hungry. Ay! and thirsty too, I
doubt not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By our Lady, but that hath a welcome sound, honest
Jacques,&#8221; cried the elder knight, starting up eagerly. &#8220;We
are both hungry and thirsty. Neither of us has broken his fast
since morning, and then the repast was but meagre. Bertrand,
man, does not the flavor of that stew assail your nostrils deliciously?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does indeed, Louis. Methinks that I shall do justice to
it. The Duke of Lorraine does not regale his prisoners on
such fare.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were prisoners to the Duke of Lorraine?&#8221; questioned
Jacques as he and his guests drew up to the table. The women
and children sat apart waiting to eat later.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay! and have been for these many weary months, Jacques.
It seems like a miracle that we did at last escape, but so it has
fallen out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell of the manner of your taking and escape, if it please
you, messire,&#8221; spoke Jacques. &#8220;&#8217;Twill enliven the hour, and
we are of the King&#8217;s party here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right well do we know that, Jacques D&#8217;Arc, else we would
not have tarried here. Domremy is well known to be for the
King.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay! for the King and France. Save for one man the entire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
village is against the Burgundians and the English invaders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis good to hear such report, Jacques. And now if you
wish to hear the tale it pleases me well to tell it. Know then
that in August last, I, Louis De Lude, and Bertrand de
Poulengy here with six other <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''men at arms'' in original text">men-at-arms</ins> did set forth from
the town of Ch&acirc;lons for that of Tours, being sadly in need
of armour. You must know that for armour there be none
in all France that can compare with the smiths of Tours.
Through fear of being set upon by either the enemy, or marauding
bands, we travelled at night, avoiding the frequented roads
and the towns known to be in possession of the hostile party.
Thus we went for ten days with no untoward event happening,
and on the morning of the eleventh day we broke into gratulation,
for then we came in sight of the walls of Tours.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sun was an hour high, and all the gates of the town
were open. Through them the country folk were passing with
milk and fruit for the market. The sight was a welcome one
to travellers weary of the road and road fare. With cries of
pleasure we spurred our horses forward. When within a half
league of the city the joyous exclamations died on our lips, for
suddenly the gates were closed, leaving us and a few poor
market people outside. The country people ran distractedly
toward the town, uttering loud outcries as the watchman appeared
on the ramparts, shouting something that we were not
near enough to understand. Wondering at the action of the
town, and the apparent terror of the people we wheeled, and
saw the cause.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The frequented road from the town wound a short distance
away between two low hills, and over the green shoulder of
one of these a dozen bright points caught and reflected the
morning light. Even as we looked the points lifted, and became
spears. Ten, twenty, thirty, still they came until we
could no longer count them. We turned to make a dash back
in the way we had come, and behold! springing up in front of
us were other spears. We were caught; and, outnumbered
though we were, there was nothing for it but to fight. And
fight we did, for in a moment they were upon us.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis hard to know just what is happening when one is
in the thick of combat. There were yells and wild cries as the
two forces came together in a huddle of falling or rearing
horses, of flickering weapons, of thrusting men, of grapples
hand to hand. Who it was fell, stabbed through and through,
or who still fought single combat I could not tell. It was over
presently, and as I yielded up my sword in surrender I glanced
about me; and lo! of our little band but three remained: Bertrand
here, Jean Laval, and myself. We had fallen into the
hands of Sabbat, the <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''free-booter'' in original text">freebooter</ins>, the terror of Anjou and
Touraine.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did not take us to his garrison at Langea&iacute;s, but retreated
to those same low hills by the road, and there cast us into a
pit to be held for ransom. Ransom? In sooth, he deserved
none, for he took from us the livres we had for our armour.
One hundred and twenty-five livres tournois did Bertrand and
I have each for that purpose, and he took them. Ay! and
likewise he robbed our comrades who were dead. But our
armour they left us, because it was old. Three months we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
stayed in that pit waiting for ransom, with bread and water for
our daily fare. And truly it was the bread of sadness and the
water of affliction. Jean died of his wounds, but Bertrand
and I came through.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then it fell upon a day that some of my Lord Duke,
Charles of Lorraine&#8217;s, retainers passed by the robbers&#8217; lair on
their way from Tours to Lorraine. Sabbat&#8217;s men set upon
them even as they had done upon us. But the Duke&#8217;s men
worsted them, and carried away not only many freebooters
as prisoners but those also who were held captive by the marauders.
Finding that Bertrand and I were Armagnacs, of the
King&#8217;s party, they took us to the ducal palace at Nancy to be
held for ransom. We were thrown into a dungeon there to
await the return of the messenger to our friends, but whether
money was ever sent either to Duke Charles or to Sabbat we
know not. All that we know is that we lay waiting, waiting
in that vile dungeon for weary days. So the time went by;
long months that sapped our vigour, but which whetted our
appetites for vengeance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were not upon parole, though my Lord Charles had
striven to put us there, so we watched for a chance to escape,
as is the right of every prisoner. It came at length. Two
days ago the old man, who was our keeper, came to us at eventide
bearing the black bread that formed our meals. He had
not brought the water, and Bertrand made a cry for it, grumbling
loudly because it had not been fetched, saying that he
was athirst. It confused the old man, because he had in very
truth forgot the water, which he was loath to acknowledge.
For this reason he neglected his usual caution of backing out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
the dungeon with his face toward us, and turned his back upon
us. Instantly we sprang upon him, and easily overcame him.
We bound him with his own garments, and then, possessing
ourselves of his keys, went forth boldly. To our amazement
we found our way into the courtyard without encountering
any one. There were sounds of revelry from the palace, and
creeping near we found that it was the anniversary of his
birthnight, so Duke Charles held high carnival. It was the
night of all nights favorable to an escape.</p>
<p>&#8220;The guard was relaxed so, unchallenged, we succeeded in
placing a scaling ladder against the ramparts, and up we went.
When we had reached the top, however, we were seen, and a
shower of arrows were shot at us, wounding Bertrand. Two
lance lengths high were the walls, but we dropped from them to
the outside, landing, by God&#8217;s grace, on the edge of the moat.
We crept close to the walls, and the fast falling darkness hid
us from the view of the archers on the top.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doubtless they thought that we had fallen into the water,
for presently the hue and cry died down, and we heard no
sound that denoted that search was being made for us. Then
cautiously we crossed the moat, fearful of its waters, but Saint
Catherine, the friend of escaping prisoners, was with us, and
reaching the other side we went forth free men once more.
How we obtained horses and the manner of coming here have
nothing of mark to relate. We did obtain them, and we came.
And that, honest Jacques, is the tale. A common one in
France.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, messire; but too common,&#8221; agreed Jacques, shaking his
head mournfully. &#8220;Truly, France has fallen upon evil days.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It has! It has! And to none other than Isabella of
Bavaria do we owe them. By that infamous treaty of Troyes
by which Charles, the Dauphin, was disinherited in favor of
Henry Fifth of England the Queen lost us France.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She lost us France,&#8221; acquiesced Jacques. The younger
knight spoke abruptly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I was at Troyes when that treaty was signed. &#8217;Twas four
years ago, and of April the ninth day. Well do I remember
it; for at the same time the ceremony that betrothed our Lady
Catherine to Henry of England was celebrated. The King,
our poor mad King, was brought from his retreat to be made
to sign the treaty, and the streets and the ramparts of the
town were filled with people desirous of seeing him. The
Dauphin was there, looking like death, and well he might; for
the kingdom which was his by right, as well as his sister&#8217;s, was
to be given to the butcher of Agincourt. His mother, Queen
Isabella, was here, there, everywhere, flaunting a robe of blue
silk damask and a coat of black velvet into the lining of which
the skins of fifteen hundred minevers had gone. Shamelessly
she made a gala day of the matter, and after the ceremony
caused her singing birds, goldfinches, siskins, and linnets to be
brought for her entertainment. And now, the Duke of Bedford
is Regent of France, holding it for Henry Fifth&#8217;s son;
and the Dauphin, who should be king since his father is dead,
lies in retreat in Bruges. Isabella lost us France. The shameless
woman!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shameless indeed, Bertrand, but take courage. Have you
never heard that though a woman should lose France, from the
march of Lorraine a Virgin shall come for its redemption?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis Merlin&#8217;s prophecy, Louis. &#8216;A Maid who is to restore
France, ruined by a woman, shall come from the Bois Chesnu
in the march of Lorraine,&#8217; is the reading. Pouf! What could
a maid do in such matters? I believe it not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; ejaculated Jacques. He laughed outright suddenly.
&#8220;Why, the Bois Chesnu is our own wood out there,&#8221;
and he jerked his thumb over his shoulder. &#8220;Messire, &#8217;tis a
prophecy that will fail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scoff not, ye doubters,&#8221; cried Louis. &#8220;With God all things
are possible. For my part, I would a Maid would come to the
healing of France. But there! &#8217;tis long since I have slept on
aught but stones, and fain would I lie upon a bed. Good
Jacques, if you have such a thing, show me it, I pray you. I
am weary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then come, messires.&#8221; Jacques lighted a candle and led
the way to an upper room, while Isabeau opened the doors of
the cupboard bed on the far side of the room, and made it ready.
Then she drew her children round her to hear their prayers and
the Credo. After which the family went to their beds.</p>
<p>But Jeanne lay down upon the floor before the hearth.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>The condition of France in this year of grace, 1424,
was deplorable in the extreme. For more than one
hundred years war had raged between England and
France. The kingdom which had been strong and splendid
under the great Charlemagne had fallen into disintegration.
Unity had no existence. By the treaty of Troyes, signed by
the mad King, Charles VI, influenced by his unscrupulous
queen, Isabella of Bavaria, Henry Fifth of England was made
Regent of France during the lifetime of Charles, and assured
of the full possession of the French throne after the mad King&#8217;s
death, thus disinheriting the Dauphin. Of the fourteen provinces
left by Charles Fifth to his successor only three remained
in the power of the French crown.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></div>
<p>It was Henry Fifth&#8217;s fond hope that by this treaty and by
his marriage with a French princess the war would cease, and
France would lie forever at the foot of England. For a time
it seemed as though these hopes were to be justified. Then, in
1422 both he and the French king died, and the war broke out
again.</p>
<p>The Duke of Bedford, Henry Fifth&#8217;s brother, assumed the
regency of France until the young son of Henry Fifth, Henry
Sixth, was old enough to be crowned. Charles, the Dauphin,
meantime declared himself king and rightful heir, and many
upheld his claim. But there were some, among them the Duke
of Burgundy, the most powerful of the princes of France, who
because of private injuries suffered at the hands of the
Dauphin, sustained the claim of the English. Thus the country
presented the sad spectacle of French princes warring
against each other and the king more furiously than they did
against the invader. Frenchmen were not Frenchmen; they
were Burgundians, Armagnacs, Bretons, or Provencaux. The
country was torn in pieces with different causes and cries.
Bands of mercenaries and freebooters ravaged and pillaged the
people with a cheerful disregard of the political party to which
they belonged.</p>
<p>Under such conditions the distress of the country was great.
Many regions were depopulated; in many the wild wood had
over run the cultivated soil; in others agriculture could be practised
only near castles and walled towns. Under the sound of
the warning horn or church bell the cattle would run of themselves
to places of refuge. When the country was so harried
and devastated it behooved the villages and towns to keep a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
watchman ever on the lookout for the glitter of lances that the
inhabitants might have time to gather their cattle and retreat
to a place of safety.</p>
<p>Nor had the march of Lorraine and Champagne, as the valley
of the river was called, been exempt from the common woe.
It was long an object of contention between monarch and duke,
but had finally passed into the hands of the crown, so that its
people were directly subject to the King. The march was not
only the highroad to Germany, but it was, too, the frontier
between the two great parties: near Domremy was one of the
last villages that held to the Burgundians; all the rest were
for Charles, the Dauphin. In all ages the valley had suffered
cruelly from war: first, the war between duke and monarch for
its possession; and now, the war between the Burgundians and
the Armagnacs. At a time when the whole of Christendom
was given up to pillage the <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''men at arms'' in original text">men-at-arms</ins> of the Lorraine-Marches
were renowned as the greatest plunderers in the world.
Therefore, life at Domremy was one perpetual alarm. All
day and all night a watchman was stationed on the square
tower of the monastery, and the inhabitants held themselves
ready to fly at a moment&#8217;s warning. And yet men sowed and
reaped; women spun and wove; children romped and sang;
and all the occupations of a rural people went on.</p>
<p>In the midst of these anxieties life at the house of Jacques
D&#8217;Arc seemed calm and serene. March passed, and dewy
April too had been gathered into the Book of Months. It was
May. The trees were masses of foliage, the meadows starry
with wild flowers, and the greenish water of the winding river
was almost hidden by the dense clumps of rushes that grew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
upon its banks. Vallis Colorum, the Valley of Colors, the
Romans had called it, and truly in this fair May it was so
radiant, and fragrant, and flowery that it well deserved the
designation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne,&#8221; said Jacques D&#8217;Arc one morning as the little girl
rose from the breakfast table and took her place before the
spinning wheel, &#8220;you can not spin to-day. I need Pierrelot in
the field, so that you must mind the sheep. Seedtime is short,
and if we do not get the sowing done soon we can not reap a
harvest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, father,&#8221; said Jeanne, rising. Taking her distaff,
for the time spent in watching the flock was not to be passed in
idleness, she went at once to the fold to lead out the sheep.
Usually the stock of the villagers was kept in sheds attached
to the houses, but the D&#8217;Arc family kept their animals in a
separate building. It was still early, but the sheep were to be
taken to the uplands, which lay beyond the common that could
not now be used for pasturing because of the growing hay, so
an early start was necessary.</p>
<p>There were already several little shepherdesses on the upland,
and Jeanne waved her hand to Hauviette and Mengette,
who were nearest. They too had their distaffs, and soon the
three friends were seated together near the oak wood pulling
the threads for spinning, chatting gaily, and ever and anon
casting watchful glances at the browsing sheep. They were
careful little maids, knowing well the value of the flocks they
tended.</p>
<p>It seemed as though all of the inhabitants of the village were
out in the open, so many men, and boys, and women were there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
engaged in sowing the fields, or busied in the vineyards on the
hill slopes. The morning was almost past when the quiet of
the peaceful scene was broken by a hoarse shout from the watchman
on the square tower of the monastery:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Burgundians! The Burgundians are coming! To the
fortress for your lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>As his voice died away the bells of the church sounded the
alarm. Noisily they pealed in a harsh and terrifying clamor,
those bells which in turn celebrated the births, tolled for the
dead, and summoned the people to prayer. Instantly the fields
and vineyards became scenes of commotion and confusion.
Hoarse shouts and cries rent the air. Men, women, and children
ran frantically toward the village, carrying their farm
tools, and driving the cattle <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''pellmell'' in original text">pell-mell</ins> before them. From the
cottages there poured forth the aged, the old men and women
who could no longer work in the fields and who therefore cared
for the young children and the houses while their juniors did
the outside work. Both the old people and the children bore
whatever of value they could carry from the cottages, and
thus burdened all ran toward the castle.</p>
<p>As the watchman gave his cry Jeanne, Mengette, and
Hauviette sprang excitedly to their feet. Dropping their
distaffs the two latter girls, leaving their flocks, ran toward the
fields where their elders were, forgetful of everything but their
own safety. But Jeanne stood still, a little line of perplexity
wrinkling her forehead. Sheep are nervous animals, and these
had lifted their heads as though startled, and were beginning
to bleat piteously. Once among the plunging, bellowing cattle
nothing could be done with them. Should they break and run
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
into the forest they would be devoured by wolves. If they
scattered in the meadows they would become the booty of the
attacking party. In either case her father would be the loser.
Only a second did she remain inactive, and then, clear and
sweet, she sounded the shepherd&#8217;s call:</p>
<p>&#8220;Cudday! Cudday! Cudday!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bell-like her voice rose above the confusion. The old bell-wether
of the flock recognized the tones of his shepherd, and
started toward her. Jeanne turned, and started toward the
village, stopping frequently to sound the call:</p>
<p>&#8220;Cudday! Cudday! Cudday!&#8221;</p>
<p>And quietly, confidently the old bell-wether followed her,
bringing the flock with him. Half way to the village she met
Pierre, who came running back to her. The lad was breathless
and panting, but he managed to gasp:</p>
<p>&#8220;Father says, father says to leave the sheep, Jeanne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nenni, nenni,&#8221; returned Jeanne. &#8220;I can bring them in
safely.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this moment there came a ringing shout from Jacques
D&#8217;Arc:</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave the cattle and sheep, friends! Make for the castle!
The foe is upon us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The terrified people glanced down the highroad along which
the raiding party was approaching. There was but scant time
to reach the fortress, and, as Jacques D&#8217;Arc had seen, it could
only be done without encumbrance. Leaving the animals
forthwith the villagers broke into a run, while Jacques hastened
to his children.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Father, I know that I could&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; began Jeanne, but her
father interrupted her vehemently,</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk not, but run, my little one. There is no time to
lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>The castle stood on an island formed by two arms of the
Meuse. Belonging to it was a courtyard provided with means
of defense, and a large garden surrounded by a moat wide and
deep. It was commonly called the Fortress of the Island.
It had been the abode of those fair ladies and brave lords who
were wont in the olden time to dance about the Fairy Tree.
The last of the lords having died without children the property
passed to his niece. The lady married a baron of Lorraine
with whom she went to reside at the ducal court of Nancy, thus
leaving it uninhabited. Wishing to have a place of retreat
from attacks of marauding parties Jacques D&#8217;Arc and another
man, on behalf of the villagers, leased the castle from the lady
for a term of nine years.</p>
<p>The precaution had been useful on many occasions, but upon
this bright, May morning it proved futile so far as the property
of the villagers was concerned. The approach of the marauders
was too rapid to permit the poor people to do more than to
reach the castle in safety. Jacques D&#8217;Arc and his two children
were the last to cross the drawbridge, which was instantly drawn
up, and the gate was closed. They were safe, for it was a
place that ten could hold against ten hundred.</p>
<p>Through the loop-holes the villagers beheld the scene that
followed. With terrifying cries the raiders rode into the hamlet.
Some rounded up the cattle and sheep preparatory to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
driving them off; others hitched oxen to carts and drove them
to the middle of the village, where still others piled the furniture
from the cottages into the carts. Silent and tearless the
hapless inhabitants watched while the hearths of their homes
were torn up, and mantels demolished in the search for hidden
treasure. Even the church was not exempt from the pillage.
And then, that no part of misery might be spared to Domremy,
the plunderers applied the torch to the houses.</p>
<p>Women wrung their hands, some dry-eyed, others with sobs
and cries at sight of their blazing homes, while men gnashed
their teeth, enraged that they were powerless to prevent the
disaster. At length the ruffian band departed, carrying their
booty with them.</p>
<p>Scarcely had they passed from view before the men were
out and across the drawbridge, and on to fight the flames.
Some of the cottages were too far consumed to be saved, but
after the flames were extinguished a few were found that could
be used with some thatching.</p>
<p>Among these was the house of Jacques D&#8217;Arc.</p>

<p>There was anguish in the eyes of Isabeau Rom&eacute;e as
she crossed the drawbridge from the castle, and went
slowly with her children to the ruined village. Other
women about her wept, or gave vent to their despair in loud
outcries; hers was the deeper grief that knows not tears.</p>
<p>And in what a state of desolation was the hamlet and its
surroundings! The <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''men at arms'' in original text">men-at-arms</ins> had plundered, ravaged, and
burnt. Unable to exact ransom from the inhabitants, because
of their timely arrival at the castle, it was evidently the
design of the marauders to destroy what they could not carry
off. The newly sown fields were trampled; the blossoming
orchards blasted; those houses that had been rescued from the
flames were badly damaged, and the entire village and its neighbour,
Greux, had been sacked and pillaged. Upon what were
the people to live? That was the question that confronted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
them. Jacques D&#8217;Arc came to his wife as she stood in front
of their cottage.</p>
<p>&#8220;The house still remains to us, Isabeau,&#8221; he said comfortingly.
&#8220;The roof can be thatched so that we can soon be in it
again. We will send to our market town of Neufch&acirc;teau for
bread and grain. Did you look well to the money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Jacques.&#8221; Isabeau took a bag from the folds of her
gown, and handed it to him. It contained a small sum of
money hoarded against just such an emergency as the present.
Her husband took it with brightening countenance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come now, &#8217;tis not so bad,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We will send at once
for the grain, that the fields may be resown without delay; and
for bread that we may live. We shall do well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed his wife, but she looked at her children. And
then, as though with that look her woe must forth, she turned
upon him in a passionate outburst: &#8220;In all your life, Jacques,
in all my life we have known naught but war. Must my children
too live always in the midst of strife? Must they too sow
for soldiers to reap? Build, for men-at-arms to burn? Be
hunted like wild beasts, and killed if they cannot pay ransom?
Must they too count on nothing; neither their goods, nor their
lives? Oh, Jacques, must France always be torn by war?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are beside yourself with sorrow, Isabeau,&#8221; chided
Jacques but the gentleness of his tone took away the sting of
the words. &#8220;&#8217;Tis no time to give way now. There is much
to be done. We can but take up our burden, and do the best
we can. With God lies the issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True, Jacques, true.&#8221; Isabeau pulled herself together
sharply. &#8220;You are right; &#8217;tis no time for grief. There is indeed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
much to be done. Jeanne, do you take your little sister,
and care for her while I see if aught of our stores has been overlooked.
Many will there be for whom provision must be
made.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this the brave woman gave the little Catherine into
Jeanne&#8217;s keeping, while she went into the cottage. Resolutely
winking back her own tears Jeanne took the weeping little girl
to a tree, and sat down under it, drawing the child into her lap.
Pierre followed her, Jacquemin and Jean going with their
father to help him. Soon Mengette and Hauviette joined the
D&#8217;Arc children, and presently all the boys and girls of the
village found their way there, comforting each other and the
little ones in their charge in whispers. Childhood is elastic,
and soon under the familiar companionship fright wore away,
and the young folks began to relate their experiences in subdued
but excited tones.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw a black Burgundian as big as a giant,&#8221; declared Colin.
&#8220;Had I had a crossbow and bolt I would have killed him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pouf! You were afraid just as the rest of us were,&#8221; uttered
Pierre scornfully. &#8220;Why, even the men did not try to
fight, so many were the enemy. And if they could do naught
neither could you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The men could not fight without weapons, Pierre,&#8221; spoke
Jeanne quickly. &#8220;They had none in the fields.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Myself, I shall be a man-at-arms,&#8221; went on Colin boastingly.
&#8220;I shall wear armour, and ride a horse; and I shall go
into France to help drive the Godons<a name='FNanchor_0004' id='FNanchor_0004'></a><a href='#Footnote_0004' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne looked at him with sparkling eyes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she cried eagerly. &#8220;&#8217;Tis what should be done. Oh!
I would like to go too. Why do they not stay in their own
country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; Colin began to laugh. &#8220;You are a girl, Jeanne
D&#8217;Arc, and girls go not to war. They can not fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could.&#8221; A resolute light came into the little maid&#8217;s eyes,
and her lips set in a firm line. &#8220;I know I could.&#8221; At this the
others joined Colin in his laughter, and the boy cried gaily:</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to see you. Oh, wouldn&#8217;t the Godons run
when they saw you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne opened her lips to reply, but just then she heard the
voice of her mother calling to her. So, shaking her finger at
Colin, she rose obediently and went toward the cottage. Near
the door stood her father gazing intently at a long rod that he
held in his hand. So absorbed was he that he did not heed her
approach. The little girl touched him lightly on the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, father?&#8221; she asked gently. &#8220;Are you grieving
over the cattle and the goods?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her father looked up with a start.</p>
<p>&#8220;I grieve, yes, my little one. But &#8217;tis not so much about
present ills as a future burden which we must bear. I know
not how it is to be met. This rod, as you know, is the taille
stick, and in July comes the tax which I must collect from Domremy
and Greux. I like not to think about it, so heavy will it
seem after the misfortune that has come upon these two villages.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were many duties that fell to the village elder (doyen),
especially in troubled times. It was for him to summon the
mayor and the aldermen to the council meetings, to cry the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
decrees, to command the watch day and night, to guard the
prisoners. It was for him also to collect taxes, rents, and
feudal dues. An ungrateful office at any time, but one that
would be doubly so in a ruined country. Jeanne knew that it
was her father&#8217;s duty to collect the taxes, but she had not known
that it might be a distasteful task. Now she looked curiously
at the stick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why does it have the notches upon it, father?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis to show the amount due, my little one. There are
two tailles:<a name='FNanchor_0005' id='FNanchor_0005'></a><a href='#Footnote_0005' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> la taille seigneuriale, which is paid serfs to their
lord; and la taille royale, which is paid to the King. We, being
directly subject to the King, pay la taille royale. The
gentle Dauphin has much need of money, Sire Robert de Baudricourt
of Vaucouleurs has told me. But the impost will be
hard to meet after what has befallen us.&#8221; He sighed.</p>
<p>At this moment Jacques D&#8217;Arc was not a prepossessing
sight. His clothes were dusty and begrimed with soot; his
face and hands were black; but through the soot and grime
shone the light of compassion for the burden which the people
would have to bear. Jeanne saw naught of the soiled clothing
or the blackened face and hands; she saw only that her father
was troubled beyond the loss of his goods and cattle. Quickly
she threw her arms about his neck, and drew his face down to
hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would there were no tax, father,&#8221; she said wistfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would so too, my little one,&#8221; sighed he. &#8220;But there!
wishing will not make it so. You have comforted me, Jeanne.
But your mother is calling. Let us go to her.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></div>
<p>With her hand in his they went into the house, where Jacques
deposited the stick in a corner. Isabeau met them, a pleased
expression illuminating her countenance.</p>
<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; she cried, holding up a great loaf of black bread.
&#8220;&#8217;Twas in the back part of the oven where it was not seen.
Take it to your playmates, Jeanne, and give to each of them a
piece of it. Children bear fasting but ill, and it will be long
ere we have bread from Neufch&acirc;teau!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne took the loaf gladly and hastened to her playmates.
She knew that they were hungry, for none of them had eaten
since early morning. Her appearance with the bread was
greeted with cries of joy. Bread was a commonplace the day
before; now it had become something precious. So little are
blessings prized until they are gone.</p>
<p>The loaf was large, but even a large loaf divided into many
pieces makes small portions. These were eaten eagerly by the
children, and the youngest began to cry for more. Jeanne had
foreseen that this would be the case, so had not eaten her
share.</p>
<p>Quietly now she divided it among the smallest tots, giving
each a morsel. Shamefacedly Pierre plucked her by the
sleeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have had none,&#8221; he remonstrated. &#8220;And I&ndash;&ndash;I have
eaten all that you gave to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is well, Pierrelot.&#8221; His sister smiled at him reassuringly.
&#8220;I shall eat when the bread comes from the market
town. We must go to the castle now. Mother said that we
were to go there after we had eaten. Every one is to sleep
there to-night.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But there are no beds,&#8221; broke in Colin in an aggrieved
tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Colin; there are no beds, but even so floors are better
than the fields. There would be no safety outside the walls
on account of the wolves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wolves?&#8221; Colin whitened perceptibly, and the children
huddled closer together. &#8220;I did not think of wolves. Is there
in truth danger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The men fear so, because some of the cattle and sheep were
trampled to death by the others, and their carcasses may draw
them. We are to use the castle until the houses are thatched.&#8221;</p>
<p>The arrangements were as Jeanne had said. The nights
were to be spent in the safety of the castle&#8217;s confines, while the
days were to be devoted to the rebuilding of the village, and
the resowing of the fields. Thus did the peasants with brave
resignation once more take up their lives. For, no matter how
adverse Fate may be, life must be lived; misfortune must be
met and overcome.</p>
<p>And the times that followed were such as to try the endurance
of the unfortunate inhabitants of Domremy to the utmost.
It was the season of the year when there was a scarcity of provisions
everywhere. From early Spring until the reaping of
the new crops the stock of food in a rural community is at its
lowest; so, though many villages of the valley shared their
stores with their unfortunate neighbors their own needs had
to be taken into consideration, therefore it came about that
Famine reared his ugly head in the linked villages of Greux and
Domremy. Many of the cruelly despoiled peasants died of
hunger.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></div>
<p>One day Jacques D&#8217;Arc gathered his family about him.
They were in their own home by this time, but its furnishings
were of the rudest. Before Jacques on the table lay a single
loaf of bread, and by it stood a pail of water. He looked at
them sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis our last loaf,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and, of provision we have
naught else. So this is our last meal, for I know not where
another can be forthcoming. We will eat to-day; to-morrow
we must do as we can. Take in thankfulness, therefore, what
lies before us.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this he cut the loaf into seven parts, giving a portion
to his wife first, then one to each of his children except Jeanne.
Hers he kept beside his own. When all had been served he
turned to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here, my little one,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Timidly, for there was something in his tone that she did not
understand, the little maid went to his side. Jacques encircled
her with his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you broken your fast to-day, my child?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne blushed, and hung her head as though guilty of wrong
doing, but did not reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have not,&#8221; he asserted. &#8220;Yesterday Pierre saw you
give all of your portion to your sister. The day before you
kept but a small part for yourself, giving Catherine the rest.
Is it not so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, father; but I go to the church and pray; then I do not
need food.&#8221; Jeanne took courage as she told this, and raising
her head looked at him bravely. &#8220;I do not feel very hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fasting is good for the soul, my child, but too much of it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
ill for the body. Stay, therefore, beside me that your father
may see you eat your share.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, father,&#8221; she began protestingly. He interrupted her:</p>
<p>&#8220;Eat,&#8221; he commanded. When Jacques spoke in that tone
his children knew that resistance was useless, so silently Jeanne
ate her portion. Nor would he permit her to leave his side
until every crumb was swallowed. She did not sit again at
table, but went to the open door and gazed down the highroad
through tear-blinded eyes. Her heart was very full. Father
and child were in close accordance, and she knew that he suffered
because of his family&#8217;s misery. So down the valley she gazed
wishing that she might do something to help him.</p>
<p>The valley had regained much of its loveliness. The trees
had leaved again; the fields were green with the new crops, and
the gardens gave promise of later abundance. There were still
black gaps among the dwellings, however; significant reminders
of the visit of the marauders. Suddenly as the little maid stood
leaning against the door, something down the road caused her
to start violently, and lean forward eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; she cried shrilly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Jeanne,&#8221; he answered apathetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are cattle and sheep coming down the highroad.
They look like ours. What does it mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Instantly Jacques sprang to his feet and hastened to the
door. One look and he gave a great shout.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are ours,&#8221; he cried in ringing tones. &#8220;Friends, neighbours,
come and see! The cattle have come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>From out of the cottages ran the people, incredulity turning
to joy as their sight verified Jacques&#8217; cry. The wildest excitement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
prevailed as the flocks and herds in charge of a number of
soldiers commanded by a young man-at-arms drew near.
From him they learned what had happened.</p>
<p>When the lady of the castle, she who had gone to live with
her spouse at the ducal court of Nancy, heard of the raid that
had been made upon the villages, she protested to her kinsman,
the Count of Vaudemont, against the wrong done to her, as she
was the lady of Domremy and Greux.</p>
<p>Now the place to which the chief of the marauding band,
Henri d&#8217;Orley, had taken the cattle and plunder was the Ch&acirc;teau
of Doulevant, which was under the immediate suzerainty
of the lady&#8217;s kinsman. As soon, therefore, as he received her
message he sent a man-at-arms with soldiers to recapture the
animals and the booty. This was done; not, however, without
a fight, in which the young commander was victorious; and so
he had brought the cattle home.</p>
<p>With tears and cries of joy the husbandmen welcomed them.
There was food in plenty, too, so the village rejoiced, and life
bade fair to be bright once more. Only the wise ones shook
their heads ominously. For were they not likely to lose the
beasts forever on the morrow?</p>
<p>Thus the days passed in the valley; nights of terror; dreams
of horror; with war everywhere around; but Jeanne grew and
blossomed as the lily grows from the muck of a swamp.</p>

<p>The summer gave place to winter; winter in turn was
succeeded by spring, and again it was summer.
Though there were raids in distant parts of the valley,
and wild rumors and false alarms, Domremy was mercifully
spared a second visitation. A strict watch was still kept, however,
for glitter of lance along the highroad, or gleaming among
the trees of the forest, but life resumed its tranquil aspect.
The men toiled in the fields or the vineyards; women spun and
wove, and looked after their households; children played or
tended the herds and flocks on the common as of yore.</p>
<p>One warm afternoon in late July Jeanne, with others of her
playmates, was on the uplands watching the flocks nibble the
short green grass. The boys and girls were scattered over the
uplands, but Mengette and Hauviette sat with Jeanne under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
the shade of a tree. The three friends were never very far
apart, and as usual their small fingers were busied with the
threads of their distaffs.</p>
<p>It was a delicious afternoon. The air, though warm, was
soft and balmy, and fragrant with the perfume of wild mignonette
and linden flowers. In the fields the ripened wheat
rippled in the breeze like a yellow sea, and scarlet poppies made
great splotches of color against the golden heads. The Meuse
flowed sluggishly through dense masses of reeds and bushes,
almost hidden by their foliage. A lovely scene, for the Valley
of Colors, always beautiful, was never more so than in Summer.
A busy scene, too; for men and boys were working in
the fields and vineyards, either cradling the ripened grain, or
tying up the vines, heavy with bunches of grapes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sheep grow restless,&#8221; spoke Jeanne suddenly, as she
noticed that some of the animals were beginning to stray apart
from their fellows. &#8220;They have nipped the grass clean here.
&#8217;Tis time to move them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I grow sleepy,&#8221; cried Mengette, yawning. &#8220;We have
been here since early morning, so &#8217;tis no wonder. If I keep
on pulling threads from this distaff I shall do like Colin yonder:
lie down on the grass and go to sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He ought not to sleep while he has the sheep to attend to,&#8221;
declared Hauviette, shaking her head. &#8220;They might stray into
the vineyards, or the forest, and he would be none the wiser.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He knows that we would not let them if we saw them,&#8221; said
Jeanne. &#8220;I think he depends on us to look after them, though
his flock is the largest one here. He ought not to be sleeping if
we move our sheep away.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>She arose as she spoke and went quickly over to where Colin
lay stretched out on the grass. Jeanne had grown taller in the
year that had passed. &#8220;She shot up like a weed,&#8221; her mother
commented as she lengthened the girl&#8217;s red woolen frocks.
There had come an expression of thoughtfulness into her face,
and her eyes seemed larger and brighter, holding a look of wonderment
as though she were puzzling over many things; but
there was no change in her gayety and high spirits. The sleeping
boy opened his eyes drowsily as she shook him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wake, Colin,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Wake, and attend to what I
tell you. We are going to take our sheep further afield. You
must wake to look after yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Colin pulled away from her grasp, and settled down for
another nap. Jeanne shook him again vigorously.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must wake, you lazy boy,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;What would
your father say to you should aught happen to the sheep?
And we are going to move ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colin sat up reluctantly at this, rubbing his eyes, and muttering
discontentedly. So drowsy did he appear that Jeanne
realized that some sort of expedient must be used to rouse him.</p>
<p>&#8220;There stands a cluster of linden flowers yonder on the edge
of the forest, Colin. They are unusually pretty, and I want
them. Your mother wants some, too. I heard her tell you to
bring her some from the fields. See if you can get to them
before I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too hot to run,&#8221; murmured the boy. &#8220;It&#8217;s just like a
girl to want a race when it&#8217;s hot. I&#8217;d rather sit still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is just what you must not do if you want to keep
awake,&#8221; persisted Jeanne, who knew that Colin would go to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
napping again if she left him as he was. &#8220;Come on! You
never have beaten me at a race, and you can&#8217;t do it to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw! I&#8217;ve never tried very hard,&#8221; grumbled Colin, getting
to his feet reluctantly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll run, but I&#8217;d much rather stay here.
I don&#8217;t see why girls want to pester a fellow so, anyway. And
why do you want to take the sheep elsewhere? They&#8217;ll do well
enough right here. Where did you say the flowers were?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yonder.&#8221; Jeanne indicated a large cluster of the yellow
linden flowers growing near an oak thicket on the edge of the
wood. These flowers grew in great abundance around the
village. &#8220;Girls,&#8221; turning toward her friends, &#8220;Colin thinks
that he can beat me running to that bunch of linden blossoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea,&#8221; laughed Mengette teasingly. &#8220;Why, he can&#8217;t
beat any of us; not even little Martin yonder, who is half his
size,&#8221; indicating a small boy whose flock browsed just beyond
Colin&#8217;s sheep. &#8220;We&#8217;ll all run just to show him. Besides, it&#8217;s
the very thing to keep us from getting sleepy. Get in line,
everybody. Come on, Martin. I&#8217;ll be the starter. There!
You will all start at three. Attention! Attention! One,
two, three,&ndash;&ndash;Go!&#8221; And laughing merrily they were off.</p>
<p>Now Jeanne often ran races with her playmates. It was a
frequent diversion of the children when they attended the
animals on the uplands, care being always exercised to run in a
direction that would bring no alarm to the flocks. Jeanne was
very fleet of foot, as had been proven on more than one occasion.
This afternoon she ran so swiftly, so easily, so without conscious
effort on her part that it seemed as though she were upborne by
wings. Reaching the flowers quite a few moments ahead of
her companions she bent over them, inhaling their perfume
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
with a sense of rapture that she had never before experienced.
Hauviette was the first one after her to reach the goal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jeanne,&#8221; she cried, gazing at her friend with wonder.
&#8220;I never saw any one run as you did. Why, your feet seemed
scarcely to touch the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne always runs as though she were flying,&#8221; spoke
Mengette now coming up. &#8220;Anyway I&#8217;m glad that Colin
didn&#8217;t beat us. He&#8217;s &#8217;way behind us all, for here is Martin
before him. For shame, Colin,&#8221; she cried, laughing, as the boy
lumbered up to them. Colin was not noted for fleetness of
foot. &#8220;Not only did Jeanne outstrip you, but Hauviette,
Martin and I did likewise. All of us got here before you.
You didn&#8217;t stand a chance for those flowers, even if Jeanne
had not run.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t waked up enough to run well,&#8221; explained Colin,
rousing to the need of defending himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne,&#8221; broke in little Martin suddenly, &#8220;go home. Your
mother wants you. I heard her calling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother wants me,&#8221; exclaimed the girl in surprise. &#8220;Why,
that&#8217;s strange! I never knew her to call me before when I was
out with a flock. Something must be the matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe there is,&#8221; said the lad. &#8220;Anyway I heard her
calling, &#8216;Jeanne! Jeanne!&#8217; just like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I must go to her,&#8221; cried Jeanne. With this she
turned and left them, hastening in some alarm to the cottage.
Her mother glanced up in surprise from her sewing as she
came through the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, child, what brings you home so early?&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;Has anything happened to the flocks?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Did you not call me, mother?&#8221; asked Jeanne innocently.
&#8220;I thought that something was wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Call you? No. What made you think that I called you?&#8221;
questioned Isabeau sharply. &#8220;You should never leave the
sheep alone on the uplands. The other children have enough
to do to mind their own animals without attending to yours.
What made you think that I called you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin said that he heard you,&#8221; Jeanne told her simply.
&#8220;He must have tried to trick me, because I beat him and Colin
in a race. I will go back to the sheep.&#8221; She started to leave
the room as she spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin is a naughty lad,&#8221; exclaimed Isabeau with some irritation.
&#8220;Nay, Jeanne; do not go back. Pierre has just come
from the fields, and I will send him. You can be of use here.
I have let you tend the sheep because your father has been so
busy that he could not spare the boys, and because of it your
sewing has been neglected. Do you, therefore, take this garment
and finish the seam while I attend to Catherine. She is
fretful of late, and does not seem well. Go into the garden,
where it is cool. I will speak to Pierrelot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obediently the little maid took the garment that her mother
held out to her, and going into the garden sat down under an
apple tree. She was quite skillful in sewing. Her mother did
exquisite needlework, and wished her daughter&#8217;s ability to equal
her own. Jeanne wished it too, so took great pains to please
Isabeau.</p>
<p>It was quiet in the garden. Quieter than it had been on the
uplands. There had been merry laughter there, and songs and
jests from the children. Here there were only the twitter of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
birds, the rustle of the leaves in the breeze, and the humming of
gold belted bees for company. So quiet was it that presently
some little birds, seeing that they had nothing to fear from the
small maiden sewing so diligently, flew down from the apple
tree and began to peck at the grass at her very feet. Jeanne
smiled as she saw them, and sat quite still so as not to frighten
them. Soon a skylark rose from the grass in the meadow
lying beyond the orchard, and in a burst of song flew up, and
up into the air, mounting higher and higher until he shone a
mere black dot in the sky. Still singing he began to descend,
circling as he came earthward, dropping suddenly like an arrow
straight into the grass, his song ceasing as he disappeared.</p>
<p>Jeanne had let her work fall into her lap as she watched the
flight of the bird, now she took it up again and began to sew
steadily. The air was still athrill with the skylark&#8217;s melody,
and the child sewed on and on, every pulse in harmony with
her surroundings. All at once something caused her to look up.</p>
<p>There was a change of some kind in the atmosphere. What
it was she could not tell, but she was conscious of something
that she did not understand. She glanced up at the sky, but
not a cloud marred its azure. It was as serene, as dazzling as
it had been all day. Bewildered by she knew not what she
picked up her sewing again, and tried to go on with it, but she
could not. She laid down the garment, and once more glanced
about her. As she did so she saw a light between her and the
church.</p>
<p>It was on her right side, and as it came nearer to her it grew
in brightness. A brightness that was dazzling. She had never
seen anything like it. Presently it enveloped her. Thrilled,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
trembling, awed, too frightened to move, the little maid closed
her eyes to shut out the glory that surrounded her. And then,
from the midst of the radiance there came a voice; sweeter than
the song of the skylark, sweeter even than the chime of the
bells she loved so well. It said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Be good, Jeanne, be good! Be obedient, and go frequently
to church. I called thee on the uplands, but thou didst not
hear. Be good, Jeanne, be good.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was all. The voice ceased. Presently the light lessened;
it faded gradually, and soon ceased to glow. The little
girl drew a long breath, and fearfully lifted her eyes. There
was naught to be seen. The garden looked the same as before.
The little birds still pecked at her feet, the leaves still rustled in
the breeze, the church wore its usual aspect. Could she have
fallen asleep and dreamed, she asked herself.</p>
<p>At this moment Isabeau called to her from the door of the
cottage:</p>
<p>&#8220;Take Catherine, Jeanne,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I do not know what
ails the child. She frets so. I will brew a posset. Do you
attend to her a few moments. Why, what ails you, my little
one?&#8221; she broke off abruptly as Jeanne came to her. &#8220;Is aught
amiss? You look distraught.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne opened her lips to reply. She thought to tell her
mother of the wonderful thing that had happened, and then,
something in Isabeau&#8217;s expression checked the words. Perhaps
the good woman was unduly worried. She was in truth
overburdened with the cares of her household. Little Catherine
was ailing, and an ailing child is always exacting. Whatever
it may have been, Jeanne found the words checked on her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
lips, and was unable to relate what had occurred. A girl
trembling on the brink of womanhood is always shy and timid
about relating the thoughts and emotions that fill her. The
unusual experience was such as needed a sympathetic and
tender listener. The mother was too anxious over the younger
child to be in a receptive mood for such confidences. So when
she said again:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is anything amiss, Jeanne?&#8221; The little girl only shook her
head, and said in a low tone:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say that the trick that Martin played upon you has
upset you,&#8221; commented Isabeau. &#8220;You ran the race, and
then ran home thinking that something was wrong with us here.
It was a mean trick, though done in sport. I shall speak to his
mother about it. The boy goes too much with that naughty
Colin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne started. The voice had said that it had called her
on the uplands. Could it be that that was what Martin had
heard?</p>
<p>If so, then it could not have been a dream. It had really
happened. She found voice to protest timidly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he did not mean to trick me, mother. Perhaps he
really thought that he heard you calling me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pouf, child! How could he, when I did not call? There!
a truce to the talk while I brew the posset. I hope that Catherine
is not coming down with sickness.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hurried into the kitchen, while Jeanne, wondering
greatly at what had taken place, took her little sister into the
garden, and sat down under another tree.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>So, half from shyness, half from fear of ridicule, the child
told no one of her strange experience, but often did the
thought of the happening come to her, and she wondered
what it could mean. Indeed so much did she dwell upon it
that Mengette rallied her upon her abstraction.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has come over you, Jeanne?&#8221; asked the latter one day
when she and Jeanne in company with other girls and women
were at the river engaged in one of the periodical washings of
the village. &#8220;Twice have I spoken to you, yet you have not
answered. Has your mother been scolding you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother scolding? Why, no!&#8221; Jeanne glanced up in surprise.
&#8220;There is naught the matter, Mengette. I was just
thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of what?&#8221; questioned her friend, but as Jeanne made no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
reply she lowered her voice and said with some asperity:
&#8220;You are thinking too much, Jeanne D&#8217;Arc. You are not a bit
like yourself, and every one is noticing it. Why, when you
come to a washing you come to laugh, to sing, to talk, and to
have a good time; but you do naught but mope.&#8221; And Mengette
gave the garments she was washing a vicious thump with
the clothes-beater.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I haven&#8217;t moped so much but that my clothes are as
clean as the ones you are washing,&#8221; retorted Jeanne, holding
up some linens for inspection, and regarding her friend with a
quizzical glance. &#8220;Mengette, those poor garments will be
beaten to a thread if you pound them much harder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mengette let her paddle drop, and pushed back her hair with
her wet hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d willingly beat them to a thread to hear you laugh,
Jeanne. Now come up closer, and I will tell you something
that Hauviette told me last night. I don&#8217;t want any one else
to hear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, wooed for the time being from her thoughts, Jeanne
moved her washing table closer to her friend&#8217;s, and the two
girls were soon deep in a low toned conversation, punctuated by
many peals of merriment. All along the bank of river the
village women and girls kneeled over their box-shaped washing
tables, open at one side, set in the water&#8217;s edge, talking as they
worked, or sometimes singing roundels and catches. As Mengette
had said, the pleasure of washing lay in the meeting of
many women and girls, and in the chatting, laughter and news-telling
between the thump, thump of the clothes-beaters. The
sound of the paddles could be heard along the valley as they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
beat and turned and dipped and turned again the coarse garments
of their families. Thus labor that would have proved
irksome performed by two or three alone was lightened by the
communion and fellowship of the many.</p>
<p>It was pleasant by the river, despite the heat of the day.
Bluebells and tall white plumes of spir&aelig;a vied with the brownish-yellow
of mignonette and the rose of meadow pink in embroidering
a delicate tracery of color against the vivid green
of the valley. The smell of new mown hay made the air fragrant,
and hills and meadows smiled under a cloudless sky.
The workers laughed, and sang, and chatted, plying always the
paddles; but at length the washing was finished. The sun was
getting low behind the Domremy hills when the last snowy
pieces were stretched upon the grass to bleach, and then, piling
large panniers high with the garments that were dried the
women lifted them to their backs, thrusting their arms into the
plaited handles to steady them, and so started homeward.
Isabeau Rom&eacute;e lingered to speak to her daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave the tables and paddles, little one,&#8221; she said, as she
saw Jeanne preparing to take them from the water. &#8220;I will
send the boys for them, and you have done enough for one day.
Know you where the lads are? I have seen naught of them
since dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father said that since the hay was cut, and there was no
sign of rain, they might have the afternoon for themselves,
mother. I think they went somewhere down the river to fish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis most likely,&#8221; said Isabeau. &#8220;I hope that they will not
meet the Maxey boys anywhere. If they do, home will they
come all bruised and bleeding, for never do boys from this side
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
of the river meet those from the Lorraine side that there is not a
fight. I like it not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis because the boys of Domremy and Greux are Armagnacs,
and those of Maxey-sur-Meuse are Burgundians,&#8221; explained
Jeanne, who did not know that ever since the world has
stood boys of one village always have found a pretext to fight
lads of another, be that pretext the difference between Armagnacs
and Burgundians, or some other. &#8220;How can they help
it, mother, when even grown people fight their enemies when
they meet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True; &#8217;tis no wonder that they fight when there is naught
but fighting in the land.&#8221; Isabeau sighed. &#8220;Would there
were no war. But there, child, let&#8217;s talk of it no more. I
weary of strife, and tales of strife. Since the boys are somewhere
along the river they needs must pass the bridge to come
home. Do you, therefore, wait here for them, and tell them
that they are to bring the tables and the paddles home. I will
go on to get the supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, mother,&#8221; assented Jeanne. So while her mother
went back to the cottage, the great pannier of clothes towering
high above her head, the little girl rinsed the box-shaped washing
tables carefully, then drew them high on the banks; after
which she sat down near the bridge to watch for her brothers.</p>
<p>She did not have long to wait. Suddenly there came shouts
and cries from the Lorraine side of the river, and soon there
came Jean and Pierre, her brothers, followed by other Domremy
lads running at full speed, and in their wake came many
Maxey boys, hurling insults and stones at their fleeing adversaries.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>On Pierre&#8217;s head was a long, deep gash that was bleeding
freely, and at that sight Jeanne burst into tears. She could
not bear the sight of blood, and a fight made her cower and
tremble. At this juncture there came from the fields G&eacute;rardin
d&#8217;&Eacute;pinal, a Burgundian, and the only man in Domremy who
was not of the King&#8217;s party. He gave a great laugh as he saw
the boys of his own village running from those of Maxey.
Then knowing how loyal Jeanne was to the Dauphin, he cried
teasingly:</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the way that the Burgundians and English are
making the &#8216;Little King of Bourges&#8217; run. (A term applied to
the Dauphin Charles by his enemies.) Soon he will be made
to leave France, and flee into Spain, or perhaps Scotland, and
then we will have for our Sovereign Lord, Henry King of
England and France.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that Jeanne grew white. Her tears ceased to flow, and
she stood up very straight and looked at him with blazing
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would that I might see thy head struck from thy body,&#8221;
she said in low intense tones. Then, after a moment, she
crossed herself and added devoutly: &#8220;That is, if it were God&#8217;s
will, G&eacute;rardin d&#8217;&Eacute;pinal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words were notable, for they were the only harsh words
the girl used in her life. Long afterward G&eacute;rardin d&#8217;&Eacute;pinal
told of them. Now he had the grace to blush, for he had not
meant to rouse the little creature to such passion. With a light
laugh he turned and went his way, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take such things so much to heart, Jeanne.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Domremy boys had reached their own side of the river
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
by this time, and therefore were safe from further attack from
their rivals. Now they gathered about Jeanne, for they had
heard what she had said to G&eacute;rardin.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you come to speak so to him, Jeanne?&#8221; cried Jean.</p>
<p>Jeanne hung her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Yes; it was because of what
he said about the gentle Dauphin; and too, I think, because of
the cut in Pierre&#8217;s head.&#8221; And with that she put her arm about
her brother, and drew him to her. &#8220;Does it hurt much?&#8221; she
asked tenderly. &#8220;Come! let me wash it off before we go home.
Mother likes not to see blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And neither do you,&#8221; exclaimed Pierre, noting her pale face.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother about it, Jeanne. It doesn&#8217;t hurt very much.&#8221;
He shrugged his shoulders with assumed indifference.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother will not like it because you have been fighting,&#8221;
went on the girl gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t mean to, Jeanne,&#8221; broke in Jean quickly. &#8220;We
came to the river to fish, but some of the Burgundian boys came
to the other side, and began to call us names, saying that we
didn&#8217;t dare to come over and fight. We ran back to the village,
and told the other boys who came back with us to show the
Maxeys that we did dare, but not one of them was to be seen.
So we crossed the bridge to the Lorraine side anyway, and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They set upon us,&#8221; interrupted Pierre excitedly. &#8220;They
had hidden in the bushes and behind trees, and as soon as we
were fairly among them they threw themselves upon us. &#8217;Twas
an ambuscade just like when Roland was set upon at Roncesvalles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And did the Domremy boys give a good account of themselves?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
queried Jeanne anxiously. &#8220;And how did you get the
gash?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jean looked embarrassed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did it,&#8221; he said at length. &#8220;It was like Olivier did to
Roland. You see we were all so mixed up when the Maxey
boys fell upon us that we couldn&#8217;t tell which were our boys, and
which were not. So, in striking out with a stick that I carried,
I thwacked Pierrelot on the head instead of one of them as I
intended. But I made up for it afterward; didn&#8217;t I, Pierre?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pierre laughed as he nodded affirmation.</p>
<p>&#8220;So did I,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I knew that Jean would feel bad about
hitting me, so we both made the Burgundians pay for it. Do
we have to carry the tables and the paddles home, Jeanne? Or
aren&#8217;t you through washing yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; we have finished, Pierre. Mother said for you boys to
carry the tables home, but since you are hurt I will help Jean
with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pouf! why, &#8217;tis nothing but a scratch,&#8221; cried Pierrelot.
&#8220;And you have been washing, too. I&#8217;ll carry my share,
Jeanne. Now let&#8217;s be getting home. I&#8217;m hungry as a wolf.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; declared Jean.</p>
<p>The supper was waiting when they reached the cottage, and
the boys&#8217; story of the ambuscade was related again to their
father and mother, who listened sympathetically. In the midst
of the recital Jeanne slipped out, and went across the garden
to the little church to vespers.</p>
<p>There was no one in the church but the Cur&eacute;, and the good
priest smiled as his little parishioner entered. He was always
sure of one auditor, whatever the state of the weather, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
Jeanne attended all services. In one transept was an image
of Saint Catherine, the patron saint of young girls, and before
this the child knelt in prayer. It was deemed presumptuous
for Christians to address God directly in prayer at this period,
so that prayers were made to the saints, who were asked to make
intercession for the suppliant. So Jeanne made her supplication
to the saint, and then took her seat, for the people were
coming in for the service.</p>
<p>Messire Guillaume Frontey, the priest, led them through a
short benediction service, and comforted and refreshed,&ndash;&ndash;Jeanne
had been much wearied by the day&#8217;s work and religion
was to her as the breath of life,&ndash;&ndash;the child passed out into the
garden.</p>
<p>There was a sweet coolness in the evening air, and the darkness
was soft and agreeable after the glare of the summer sun.
So pleasant was the night that Jeanne stopped under an apple
tree, loath to enter the warm cottage. Presently, through the
darkness, there came the light that she had seen before. A
light so bright, so glowing in its radiance that she sank to her
knees awed by the luminosity. She was not so frightened as
when it had come before, yet still she dared not lift her eyes to
gaze upon its wonder. Tremblingly she waited for the voice
that she knew would follow. As it spake the bells of the church
began to ring for compline. Mingled with their chimes
sounded tones so sweet that her eyes filled at their tenderness:</p>
<p>&#8220;I come from God to help thee live a good and holy life,&#8221; it
said. &#8220;Be good, Jeanne, and God will aid thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was all. The light faded gradually, and when it was
gone Jeanne rose to her feet.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It was the voice of an angel,&#8221; she whispered in awed tones.
&#8220;The voice of an angel, and it spoke to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>And from that time forth Jeanne D&#8217;Arc had no doubt but
that an angel had spoken to her. To children, especially
religious little ones, Heaven is always very near, and that one
of its denizens should come to them does not seem so improbable
as it does to mature minds. For some time she stood lost in
wonderment at the miraculous happening, then slowly and
thoughtfully she went into the cottage, going at once to her
own little room.</p>
<p>This room was on the side of the cottage toward the church
where the eaves sloped low. From her tiny window she could
see the sacred light on the altar, and with hands clasped, Jeanne
knelt before the open sash, gazing devoutly upon it. It
seemed to her that the threshold of Heaven was reached by
that little church.</p>

<p>From this time forth the Voice became frequent.
Again and again she heard it; chiefly out of doors, in
the silence and freedom of the fields or garden. In
time the Heavenly radiance resolved itself into the semblance
of a man, but with wings and a crown on his head: a great
angel, surrounded by many smaller ones. The little maid knew
him by his weapons and the courtly words that fell from his
lips to be Saint Michael, the archangel who was provost of
Heaven and warden of Paradise; at once the leader of the
Heavenly Hosts and the angel of judgment.</p>
<p>Often had Jeanne seen his image on the pillar of church or
chapel, in the guise of a handsome knight, with a crown on his
helmet, wearing a coat of mail and bearing a lance. Sometimes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
he was represented as holding scales. In an old book
it is written that &#8220;the true office of Saint Michael is to make
great revelations to men below, by giving them holy counsels.&#8221;</p>
<p>In very remote times he had appeared to the Bishop of
Avranches and commanded him to build a church on Mount
Tombe, in such a place as he should find a bull hidden by
thieves; and the site of the building was to include the whole
area trodden by the bull. The Abbey of Mont-Saint-Michel-au-P&eacute;ril-de-la-Mer
was erected in obedience to this command.</p>
<p>About the time that Jeanne was having these visions the
English were attacking Mont-Saint-Michel, and the defenders
of the fortress discomfited them. The French attributed the
victory to the all-powerful intercession of the archangel.
Therefore, Saint Michael was in a fair way to become the
patron saint of the French instead of Saint Denys, who had
permitted his abbey to be taken by the English. But Jeanne
knew nothing of what had happened in Normandy.</p>
<p>The apparition was so noble, so majestic in its appearance
that at first the little maid was sore afraid, but his counsels were
so wise and tender that they overcame her fear.</p>
<p>One day he said to her: &#8220;Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret
will come to thee. Act according to their advice; for they
are appointed to guide thee and counsel thee in all that thou
hast to do, and thou mayest believe what they shall say unto
thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne was glad when she heard this promise, for she loved
both these saints. Saint Marguerite was highly honoured in
the Kingdom of France, where she was a great benefactress.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
She was the patron saint of flax spinners, nurses, vellum-dressers,
and of bleachers of wool.</p>
<p>Saint Catherine had a church at Maxey on the other side
of the Meuse, and Jeanne&#8217;s little sister bore her name. Often
had she repeated the rhymed prayer that was used in the saint&#8217;s
honour throughout the Valley of Colors:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;Hail, thou holy Catherine,<br />
<span class='indent1'>&nbsp;</span>Virgin Maid so pure and fine.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Both the saints were martyrs. Jeanne had heard their
stories many times from her mother, so she awaited their coming
eagerly.</p>
<p>It was in the woods, near the Fairy Tree, that they first
came to her. It was a Saturday, the day held sacred to the
Holy Virgin, and Jeanne made a little pilgrimage through the
forest up the hill path beyond Greux to the Oratory of Our
Lady of Belmont. With her tiny savings the child had bought
a candle to burn on the altar, and also carried wild flowers to
make the holy place as fragrant as the forest at its doors. She
finished her orisons, placed her candle on the altar and laid
her flowers on the shrine, then slowly started down the <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''hill-path'' in original text">hill path</ins>.
Soon, finding herself near The Gooseberry Spring, she
knelt upon its brink for a drink from its pellucid waters. It
was very quiet in the clearing about the Spring, and over the
grassy space lay a grateful shade. The day was warm, and
after her drink Jeanne sat down on a natural seat formed by
the gnarled roots of a tree. Her hands lay loosely, one reposing
in the other in her lap. Her head drooped, and she lost
herself in thought.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></div>
<p>All at once an odour, marvellously sweet, diffused itself on
the air about her. It was a perfume the like of which she had
never inhaled before. She lifted her head quickly, and drew a
long deep breath, glancing around her for the blossoms that
emitted such fragrance.</p>
<p>As she did so there came a slight rustling of leaves among
the trees, and from the Heavens there seemed to shoot downward
a splendid effulgence. An unearthly light that flooded
the place with glory. A look of rapture came into Jeanne&#8217;s
face. She rose, and crossed herself devoutly, then curtsied low
as from the splendor there issued two shining figures, clad like
queens, with golden crowns on their heads, wearing rich and
precious jewels. The little maid could not look upon their
faces by reason of the dazzling brightness that proceeded from
them, but she knelt and kissed the hem of their garments.
Gravely the saints returned her salutations, then spoke, naming
each other to her. So soft and sweet were their tones that
the sound filled her with a vague happiness, causing her to
weep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daughter of God,&#8221; they said, &#8220;rise, and listen. We come
to teach thee to live well that thou mayest be prepared for thy
mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Further they spoke to her, but soon the brilliancy began to
dim, and Jeanne caught at their garments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do not leave me,&#8221; she cried entreatingly. &#8220;Take me
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; came the answer. &#8220;Thy time is not yet, Daughter
of God. Thy work is yet to be done.&#8221;</p>

OFTEN THEY APPEARED IN THE LITTLE GARDEN<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>With these words the gentle forms disappeared, and Jeanne
flung herself upon the place where they had stood, weeping in
an anguish of tenderness and longing.</p>
<p>The saints visited her nearly every day after this. She met
them everywhere; sometimes in the woods, or near the Spring;
often they appeared in the little garden close to the precincts
of the church, and especially did they come when the bells were
ringing for matins or compline. It was then that she heard
the sweet words that they spoke most distinctly. So she loved
the sound of the bells with which the voices mingled. Soon
she grew to call the visions &#8220;My Voices,&#8221; for the appearance of
her visitors was always more imperfect to her than the message.
Their outlines and their lovely faces might shine uncertain in
the excess of light, but the words were always plain.</p>
<p>The piety and devotion of the girl deepened into a fervid
wonder of faith. She put aside the gayety of girlhood, and
lived a simple, devout, tender life, helping her mother, obeying
her father, and doing what she could for every one. It seemed
to her that she was one set apart, subject to the Divine guidance.
Nor did she tell any one of her experiences, but locked
the Divine secret in her heart, showing forth the tenderness and
gravity of one who bears great tidings. She became so good
that all the village wondered at her, and loved her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne confesses oftener than any of you,&#8221; the Cur&eacute; told
his parishioners reprovingly. &#8220;When I celebrate mass I am
sure that she will be present whether the rest of you are or not.
Would that more of you were like her! Had she money
she would give it to me to say masses.&#8221; The good man sighed.
Money was not plentiful in Domremy.</p>
<p>But if she had not money the child gave what she had: flowers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
for the altars, candles for the saints, and loving service to all
about her. She was an apt pupil in the school of her saints,
and learned well to be a good child before she conned the great
lesson in store for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne grows angelic,&#8221; Isabeau remarked complacently one
day to Jacques. &#8220;There never was her like. So good, so
obedient, she never gives me a bit of trouble. And what care
she takes of her little sister! Catherine has been hard to attend
this summer, so fretful and ailing as she is, but Jeanne can
always quiet her. I know not what I should do without her.
I am the envy of all the women in the village; for, they say,
there is not another girl so good in the valley.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jacques D&#8217;Arc frowned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too quiet and staid is she for her age,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;Have you marked, Isabeau, that she no longer dances with
the other children? Nor does she romp, or play games with
them. And the praying, and the church-going! There is too
much of it for the child&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jacques!&#8221; exclaimed his wife in shocked tones. &#8220;How can
you say that? The good Cur&eacute; commends Jeanne for her devoutness.
That can only do her good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what is it?&#8221; demanded the father impatiently.
&#8220;Could it be that some one is teaching the girl letters, that she
is so quiet? Learning of that sort works harm to a lass.&#8221;</p>
<p>His wife shook her head emphatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;She knows not A from B, Jacques. Everything she knows
is what she has learned from me. I have taught her the Credo,
the Paternoster, the Ave Marie, and have told her stories of
the saints: things that every well-taught child should know.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
She is skilled, too, in housework. I have seen to that. And
as for sewing and spinning, there is not her equal in this whole
valley. There is naught amiss, Jacques. If there is, &#8217;tis more
likely the harm that she has received from tales of bloodshed
which every passerby brings of the war. Often do I wish that
we did not live on the highroad.&#8221; The good dame shook her
head as she glanced through the open door of the cottage to the
great road where even at that moment creaking wains were
passing laden with the cloths of Ypres and Ghent.</p>
<p>Often instead of wagons there were men-at-arms, and
Isabeau feared the glitter of lances. In war it is not assault
and plundering that takes the heart and saps the courage, but
the ever present dread that they will happen. Fugitives from
the wars stopped for bite and sup, and recounted their stories
which were often of great suffering. Such tales have effect,
and Isabeau herself being influenced by them did not doubt but
that her children were moved in like manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;The children hear too much of battles, and the state of
France,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay; such things make no lasting impression upon children,
Isabeau. It is well that they should know something of what
goes on beyond the valley. Perchance the child is threatened
with the Falling Sickness. She wears no charm against it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was an age of superstition. That Jacques D&#8217;Arc should
believe that a charm could ward off epilepsy was only what all
men believed at the time. He was an austere man, but fond of
his family, and his daughter&#8217;s quietness and growing devoutness
had aroused in him a feeling of uneasiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is naught amiss with the child, Jacques,&#8221; spoke his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
wife, consolingly. &#8220;She would come to me with it if there were.
She is becoming more thoughtful as she grows older; that is
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like it not,&#8221; grumbled Jacques, shaking his head as though
but half convinced. &#8220;I much fear that something is wrong.
It is not fitting that so young a girl should be so pious. Is not
that a Friar turning in from the highway, Isabeau?&#8221;</p>

<p>Isabeau glanced toward the man who was nearing the
cottage. He was clad in the frock of the Order of Saint
Francis, and was carrying a heavy staff.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis one of the Grey Friars,&#8221; she exclaimed; &#8220;and supper
is not yet started. I must hurry to get it upon the table, for
he may be hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is a Grey Friar let him get on to Neufch&acirc;teau,&#8221;
grumbled Jacques. &#8220;They have a house there, and &#8217;tis but five
miles further on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jacques,&#8221; ejaculated his wife reprovingly, &#8220;what are you
saying? The poor father may be weary. If he were a man-at-arms
you would give him welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he were a man-at-arms he would have something worth
hearing to tell,&#8221; retorted Jacques. In spite of his words, however,
he rose as the friar came to the door, and saluted him but
with scant courtesy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Pax vobiscum, my son,&#8221; said the friar humbly. &#8220;Perchance
for the love of God you will give a poor brother of the Order of
the Blessed Francis somewhat to eat, and a place to abide for
the night. I have travelled far, and am aweary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enter, father,&#8221; spoke Jacques shortly. &#8220;Supper will soon
be upon the table, and a bed shall be made for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, my son. A benediction upon you, and upon
your house,&#8221; returned the priest so mildly that Jacques&#8217; manner
softened. He was not usually churlish to guests, unbidden
though they might be; but he was anxious and uneasy over his
daughter, and her fervid zeal for the church caused him to
regard churchmen with temporary disfavor. At the monk&#8217;s
tone, however, he threw wide the door and gave him a seat with
more show of cordiality.</p>
<p>The friar had scarcely seated himself before Jeanne entered,
bearing a flagon of fresh water and a cup which she carried
directly to him. Bending low before him she said gently:</p>
<p>&#8220;Drink, good father. You must be thirsty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am, my child.&#8221; The Franciscan quaffed the water gratefully,
saying, as he gave back the cup: &#8220;I have travelled many
leagues, even from Rome, where I have been upon a pilgrimage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From Rome?&#8221; ejaculated Jacques D&#8217;Arc, turning round
with eagerness. &#8220;Hear you that, Isabeau? The holy man has
been to Rome. Hasten with the supper; he must be hungry.&#8221;
With this he busied himself to make the priest more comfortable.
To make a pilgrimage to Rome cast a glamour of sanctity
about him who made it, and exalted him in the eyes of
all men.</p>

&#8220;THE HOLY MAN HAS BEEN TO ROME&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>Jeanne smiled as her father and mother bustled about the
friar, and quietly occupied herself with preparations for the
supper. It was soon ready, and eaten with all the hearty relish
of honest, human hunger. After it was over the best place by
the fire was given the friar&ndash;&ndash;already the evenings were beginning
to grow chill&ndash;&ndash;and the family gathered around him. As
has been said before, in return for their entertainment travellers
were expected to regale their hosts with whatsoever news they
might be possessed of, or with tales of their travels or adventures.
The Franciscan proved to be most agreeable.</p>
<p>He told of his pilgrimage, and described at length the appearance
of the holy city. He spoke also of having seen and
spoken with the holy Colette of Corbie, that famous nun whose
miracles of healing were then the wonder of the Christian
world.</p>
<p>At this they crossed themselves, and were silent for a little
from very awe from having among them a man who had been
so favored. Then Isabeau, who was devoted to sacred things
and saintly legends, said timidly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Perchance, good father, you have about you a relic, or a
ring that hath been touched by the blessed Sister Colette?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would that I had,&#8221; spoke the friar devoutly. &#8220;I would
cherish it above all things, but I have not. It is true, however,
that I have a ring. It hath not been blessed, nor does it
possess power to perform miracles. Nathless, it does have
great virtue, having been made by a holy man, and by reason
of herbs, which have been curiously intermingled with the
metal under the influence of the planets, is a sovereign charm
against the Falling Sickness.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></div>
<p>Jacques looked up with quick interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us see the ring, messire,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is, if it please
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It pleases me right well,&#8221; answered the friar, drawing a
small ring from the bosom of his frock.</p>
<p>It was of electrum, a kind of brass at this time called the gold
of the poor. It was an ordinary trifle, but to the peasant and
his family it was rich and wonderful. There was no stone or
seal, but a broad central ridge, and two sloping sides engraved
with three crosses, and the names Jesus and Maria. Such rings
were common; sometimes instead of the holy names there were
figures of Saints, the Virgin Mary, or a priest with the chalice.
A ring, an amulet, a relic that was supposed to be blessed, or to
have virtue against disease appealed to the marvel loving part
of their natures, so that the people eagerly sought such articles.
They desired above all else to possess the precious thing, or that
they might touch it with some treasured possession that some
of its virtues might pass into themselves. So now Jacques&#8217; eyes
met those of his wife&#8217;s in a glance of understanding. Isabeau
voiced the thought that filled them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you sell this ring, good father?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay; it is not for sale. I but showed it in lieu of a precious
relic. &#8217;Tis but a bauble compared to many holy relics that I
have seen. Nathless, the ring hath its properties.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jacques handed the ring back to him with regret showing
plainly on his honest face.</p>
<p>&#8220;That I am sorry to hear,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The little one here
hath no charm against the Falling Sickness, and I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
minded to buy it for her. She has been o&#8217;er quiet of late.&#8221;</p>
<p>The friar glanced at Jeanne, who had sat listening attentively
to his stories with shining eyes. Then he smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is for this little maid who waited not to be bidden to
bring me drink when I was weary and thirsty, I will sell,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Nay, not sell; but if ye are so minded to give alms for a
convent that is being builded by the Sisters of Saint Claire,
then may you have it. I know in very truth that it will prove
efficacious against the Falling Sickness.&#8221; Again the priest
smiled at Jeanne. There was naught about the pale purity of
her face that denoted ill health, and therefore the good priest
might speak with authority.</p>
<p>Jacques drew the girl to him, and taking the ring from the
Franciscan fitted it to the third finger of her left hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like it, my little one?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Jeanne&#8217;s eyes glistened. Like most girls she was fond of
pretty things, and she had never had a ring. To her it was
very precious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you in truth going to get it for me, father?&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Jacques nodded, pleased that she liked the trifle.
&#8220;Isabeau, give the father the alms he wishes so that we may
have the ring for the little one. It is given to you by both your
mother and myself, my child,&#8221; he continued as Isabeau brought
forth the alms for the friar. &#8220;Wear it as such, and may it
protect you not only from the Falling Sickness but from other
ills also.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this Jeanne threw her arms about his neck, and kissed
him, then running to her mother kissed her also.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It is so pretty,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;And see! it hath the two most
holy names upon it.&#8221; Her glance rested lovingly upon the
engraved characters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us see it, Jeanne,&#8221; spoke Pierre. &#8220;Sometime,&#8221; he
whispered as she came to him to show it, &#8220;sometime I am going
to give you a ring all by myself that shall be prettier than this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as though any ring could be prettier than this, Pierrelot,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;There couldn&#8217;t be one; could there, Jean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nenni.&#8221; Jean shook his head emphatically as he examined
the ring critically. &#8220;I like it better than the one Mengette
wears.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Blessed Colette hath a ring which the Beloved Apostle
gave to her in token of her marriage to the King of kings,&#8221; now
spoke the Cordelier. &#8220;Many are there who come to Corbie to
touch it, that they may be healed of their infirmities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus the talk went on; sometimes of the Saints and their
miracles, then verging to the war, and the state of the kingdom.
It was late when at length the family retired.</p>
<p>Jeanne was delighted with the gift. As a usual thing
peasants did not bestow presents upon their families. Life
was too severe in the valley, and necessities too hard to come by
in the ferment of the war to admit of it. When next her
Saints appeared, and Saint Catherine graciously touched the
ring, Jeanne&#8217;s joy knew no bounds. Thereafter she was wont
to contemplate it adoringly. But, while the ring might be
sovereign against epilepsy, it did not rouse her into her oldtime
joyousness.</p>
<p>She was very grave, very thoughtful, very earnest at this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
time. She went on thinking for others, planning for others,
sacrificing herself for others, just as always before. She ministered
to the sick and to the poor, and gave her bed to the
wayfarer as always, performing all her duties with sweet exactness,
but she was quiet and abstracted. For her Saints came
with greater frequency than ever now, and constantly they
spoke to her of her mission.</p>
<p>&#8220;What can they mean?&#8221; she asked herself. &#8220;What is it
that I am to do?&#8221; But weeks passed before she was told.</p>
<p>The smiling summer merged into Autumn, the season of
heavy rains. Brooks rushed down from the hills, and the
Meuse was swollen into a torrent, deep and rapid, which overflowed
its banks in shallow lagoons. The clouds grew lower,
leaning sullenly against the Vosges hills. Fogs came down
thick and clinging. The river was rimed with frost. Snow
and sleet drove along the Marches, and it was winter. The
Valley of Colors lay grave, austere, and sad; no longer brilliantly
hued, but clothed in a garb of white which gleamed
palely when the clouds were scattered by the rays of a red, cold
sun. There was no travel along the highway, and the gray,
red-roofed villages were forced to depend upon themselves for
news and social intercourse.</p>
<p>To all appearance life in the house of Jacques D&#8217;Arc went as
peacefully, as serenely, as that of his neighbors, and in no wise
differently. There was not one who suspected that Jeanne
visited with saints and angels; that she walked with ever listening
ear for the Voices to tell her what her divine mission was
to be. No one suspected it, for even her youthful friendships
continued, and she visited and was visited in turn by Mengette
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
and Hauviette; often passing the night with one or the other
of them as has been the fashion of girls since the beginning of
time. Both the girls rallied her on her changed spirits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every one says that you are the best girl in the village,
but that you are odd,&#8221; Hauviette confided to her one day in
winter when she and Mengette were spending the afternoon
with Jeanne.</p>
<p>The latter glanced up from her spinning with a smile.
&#8220;And what do you say, Hauviette?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say that you are better than any of us,&#8221; answered her
friend quickly. &#8220;Still,&#8221; she hesitated, and then spoke abruptly,
&#8220;there is a change though, Jeanne. You are not so lively as
you were. You never dance, or race with us, or play as you
were wont to do. What is the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; cried Mengette. &#8220;She goes to church too much.
And she prays too often. My! how she does pray! Perrin
le Drapier told me that when he forgot to ring the bells for
compline she reproached him for not doing his duty, because she
loved to pray then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you, Mengette?&#8221; asked Jeanne quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. Why, of course,&#8221; answered Mengette. &#8220;But I
don&#8217;t give the sexton cakes to ring the bells when he forgets
them. You are getting ready to be a saint, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne blushed scarlet at this, and did not speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is that already,&#8221; broke in Hauviette. &#8220;Perhaps she
does not feel like playing or dancing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; spoke Jeanne suddenly, giving her friend a
grateful glance. &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like it any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we shan&#8217;t ask you to do it any more,&#8221; declared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
Hauviette, who loved her dearly. &#8220;And you shan&#8217;t be teased
about it, either. So there now, Mengette!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if she doesn&#8217;t feel like it, that&#8217;s different,&#8221; exclaimed
Mengette, who was fond too of Jeanne in her own fashion.
&#8220;But I do wish you did, Jeanne. There&#8217;s not half the fun in
the games now as there was when you played. But I won&#8217;t
say anything more about it. You&#8217;ll feel better about it by and
by.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the matter was not referred to again by the two girls,
though the change in Jeanne became more and more marked, as
the days went by. Winter was nearing its close when at last
she was told what her mission was to be. It was Saint Michael
who unfolded it to her.</p>
<p>It was a cold morning, and the little maid had been to early
mass. There had not been many present, and the house was
cold, but the Cur&eacute; smiled tenderly when he saw the small figure
in its accustomed place, and Jeanne&#8217;s heart glowed in the sunshine
of his approval. So she did not mind the chill of the
church, but started on her return home in an uplifted and
exalted frame of mind. To the child, nourished on sacred
things, religion was as bread and meat. And then, all at once,
the Light came.</p>
<p>It was of unusual splendor, and glowed with hues that stained
the snow covered earth with roseate tints like those of the roses
of Paradise. From the dazzling effulgence emerged the form
of Saint Michael, clothed in grandeur ineffable. In his hand
he held a flaming sword, and around him were myriads of
angels, the hosts of Heaven whose leader he was. The old
fear fell upon Jeanne at sight of his majesty, and she sank
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
tremblingly upon her knees, covering her face with her hands.
But when the tender, familiar:</p>
<p>&#8220;Be good, Jeanne, and God will help thee,&#8221; fell from his
lips, she ceased a little to tremble.</p>
<p>Then with infinite gentleness the archangel began to speak to
her of France, and the &#8220;pity there was for it.&#8221; He told her
the story of her suffering country: how the invader was master
in the capital; how he was all powerful in the country north
of the Loire; how internally France was torn and bleeding by
the blood feud between the Duke of Burgundy and the disinherited
Dauphin; how great nobles robbed the country which
they should have defended, and how bands of mercenaries
roved and plundered. The rightful king soon must go into
exile, or beg his bread, and France would be no more.</p>
<p>The young girl&#8217;s heart already yearned over the woes of
her distressed country, but now it swelled almost to bursting
as she heard the recital from angelic lips. The &#8220;great pity
that there was for France&#8221; communicated itself to her, and
she felt it in every chord of her sensitive nature. The great
angel concluded abruptly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Daughter of God, it is thou who must go to the help of the
King of France, and it is thou who wilt give him back his
kingdom.&#8221;</p>
<p>But at this Jeanne sprang to her feet, astounded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I, Messire? I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even thou, Jeanne. It is thou who must fare forth into
France to do this. Hast thou not heard that France ruined
by a woman shall by a virgin be restored? Thou art the
Maid.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>But terrified and weeping the girl fell prostrate before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I, Messire. Oh, not I. It cannot be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou art the Maid,&#8221; was all he said.</p>
<p>With this Jeanne found herself alone.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Thou art the Maid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over and over the young girl repeated the words
in a maze of incredulity and wonder. That she,
Jeanne D&#8217;Arc, should be chosen for such a divine commission
was unbelievable. She was poor, without learning, a peasant
girl who had no powerful friends to take her to the Court,
and ignorant of all that pertained to war. Her judgment and
common sense told her that such a thing could not be. True,
the ancient prophecy of Merlin, the Magician, said that a
maiden from the Bois Chesnu in the March of Lorraine should
save France. True also was the fact that from her infancy
she had played in that ancient wood; could even then behold its
great extent from her father&#8217;s door. Yet, despite these actualities,
it could not be that she was the delegated Maid.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>So, while the archangel came again and again urging the
high mission with insistency the girl protested shrinkingly.
Time after time he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Daughter of God, thou shalt lead the Dauphin to Reims,
that he may there receive worthily his anointing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again and again Jeanne replied with tears:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am but a poor girl, Messire. I am too young to leave
my father and my mother. I can not ride a horse, or couch a
lance. How then could I lead men-at-arms?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou shalt be instructed in all that thou hast to do,&#8221; she
was told.</p>
<p>As time passed, unconsciously Jeanne became filled with
two great principles which grew with her growth until they
were interwoven with every fibre of her being: the love of God,
and the desire to do some great thing for the benefit of her
country. Her heart ached with the longing. So it came
about that the burden of France lay heavy upon her. She
could think of nothing but its distress. She became distrait
and troubled.</p>
<p>Gradually, as the Voices of her Heavenly visitants grew
stronger and more ardent, the soul of the maiden became holier
and more heroic. She was led to see how the miraculous suggestion
was feasible; how everything pointed to just such a
deliverance for France. Her country needed her. From under
the heel of the invader where it lay bruised and bleeding it
was calling for redemption. And never since the morning
stars sang together has there been sweeter song than the call
of country. Ever since the Paladins of Charlemagne, as the
Chanson de Roland tells, wept in a foreign land at the thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
of &#8220;sweet France,&#8221; Frenchmen had loved their native land
and hated the foreigner. What wonder then, that when the
divine call came, it was heard and heeded?</p>
<p>She still resisted, but her protests were those of one who
is weighing and considering how the task may be accomplished.
Months passed. There came a day in May, 1428, when
Jeanne&#8217;s indecision ended. She was sixteen now, shapely and
graceful, and of extraordinary beauty.</p>
<p>It was a Saturday, the Holy Virgin&#8217;s day, and the girl set
forth on her weekly pilgrimage to the chapel of Bermont, where
there was a statue of the Virgin Mother with her divine child in
her arms. Jeanne passed through Greux, then climbed the
hill at the foot of which the village nestled. The path was overgrown
with grass, vines, and fruit-trees, through which she
could glimpse the green valley and the blue hills on the east.
Deeply embedded in the forest the chapel stood on the brow
of the hill, and she found herself the only votary. She was
glad of this, for to-day Jeanne wished to be alone. Prostrating
herself before the statue, she continued long in prayer; then,
comforted and strengthened, she went out of the chapel, and
stood on the wooded plateau. To all appearance she was gazing
thoughtfully off into the valley; in reality she waited with
eager expectancy the coming of her celestial visitants.</p>
<p>Very much like a saint herself Jeanne looked as she stood
there with uplifted look. There was in her face a sweetness
and serenity and purity that reflected her spiritual nature.
Her manner was at once winning, inspiriting and inspired.
She did not have long to wait for the appearance of Saint
Michael. Long communing with her Saints had robbed her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
of all fear in their presence, so now when the archangel stood
before her Jeanne knelt, and reverently kissed the ground
upon which he stood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daughter of God,&#8221; he said, &#8220;thou must fare forth into
France. Thou must go. Thou must.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Jeanne could utter no reply. She knew that
the command must be obeyed. She had sought the retirement
of the forest that she might inform her saints that she
accepted the charge, and she most often met them in the silence
and quiet of the fields, the forest, or garden. She had sought
them to tell them of her decision, but at the thought of leaving
her father, her mother, her friends, and the valley she loved
so well, her courage faltered. Faintly she made her last protest:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so young,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So young to leave my father
and my mother. I can sew; can use with skill either the needle
or the distaff, but I can not lead men-at-arms. Yet if it be
so commanded, if God wills it, then I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Her voice broke, and
she bent her head low in submission before him.</p>
<p>At her words the wonderful light burst into marvellous brilliancy.
It drenched the kneeling maiden in its dazzling radiance,
pervading her being with a soft, warm glow. The faith
that power would be given her to accomplish what was required
of her was born at this instant; thereafter it never left her.
When the archangel spoke, he addressed her as a sister:</p>
<p>&#8220;Rise, daughter of God,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This now is what you
must do: Go at once to Messire Robert de Baudricourt, captain
of Vaucouleurs, and he will take you to the King. Saint
Margaret and Saint Catherine will come to aid you.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></div>
<p>And Jeanne D&#8217;Arc arose, no longer the timid, shrinking
peasant girl, but Jeanne, Maid of France, consecrated heart
and soul to her country. The time had come when she must
go forth to fulfill her incredible destiny.</p>
<p>Henceforth she knew what great deeds she was to bring
to pass. She knew that God had chosen her that through
Him she might win back France from the enemy, and set the
crown on the head of the Dauphin.</p>
<p>It was late when at length she left the precincts of the
chapel, and passed down the hill path, and on to the fields
of Domremy. Pierre was at work in one of the upland meadows,
and as he wielded the hoe he sang:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;Dread are the omens and fierce the storm,<br />
<span class='indent1'>&nbsp;</span>O&#8217;er France the signs and wonders swarm;<br />

<span class='indent1'>&nbsp;</span>Well may we weep for France the fair,<br />
<span class='indent1'>&nbsp;</span>Of her noble barons despoiled and bare.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>It was the Song of Roland. The song that no French
heart can hear unmoved. Jeanne thrilled as she heard it. Did
Pierre too feel for their suffering country? Swiftly she went
to him, and, throwing her arm across his shoulder, sang with
him:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;Yet strike with your burnished brands&ndash;&ndash;accursed<br />
<span class='indent1'>&nbsp;</span>Who sells not his life right dearly first;<br />

</td></tr></table>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>Pierre turned toward her with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;How you sang that, Jeanne. Just as though you would like
to go out and fight for France yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would,&#8221; she replied quickly. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you, Pierrelot?&#8221;</p>
<p>Something in her tone made the boy look at her keenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;How your eyes shine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And somehow you seem
different. What is it, Jeanne? The song?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Partly,&#8221; she told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it does make a fellow&#8217;s heart leap.&#8221; The youth spoke
thoughtfully. &#8220;It always makes me feel like dropping everything
to go out to fight the English and Burgundians.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will go together, Pierrelot,&#8221; spoke his sister softly.
&#8220;We&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that about going to fighting?&#8221; demanded their
father, who had drawn near without being perceived. &#8220;Let
me hear no more of that. Pierre, that field must be finished by
sundown. Jeanne, your mother has need of you in the house.
There is no time for dawdling, or singing. Go to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, father.&#8221; Dutifully the maiden went at once to the
cottage, while Pierre resumed his hoeing.</p>
<p>The conversation passed from the lad&#8217;s mind, but it was
otherwise with Jacques D&#8217;Arc. He had heard his daughter&#8217;s
words, &#8220;We will go together, Pierrelot,&#8221; and they troubled
him.</p>
<p>The following morning he appeared at the breakfast table
scowling and taciturn, making but small pretence at eating.
Presently he pushed back from the table. His wife glanced
at him with solicitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;What ails you, Jacques?&#8221; she queried. &#8220;Naught have you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
eaten, which is not wise. You should not begin the day&#8217;s
work upon an empty stomach.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I get you some fresh water, father?&#8221; asked Jeanne.</p>
<p>Jacques turned upon her quickly, and with such frowning
brow that, involuntarily, she shrank from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hark you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I dreamed of you last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of me, father?&#8221; she faltered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I dreamed that I saw you riding in the midst of
men-at-arms.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this both Jean and Pierre laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just think of Jeanne being with soldiers,&#8221; exclaimed Jean.
&#8220;Why, she would run at sight of a Godon.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was no answering smile on the face of their father.
According to his belief there was but one interpretation to be
put upon such a dream. Many women rode with men-at-arms,
but they were not good women. So now, bringing his
fist down upon the table with a resounding thwack, he roared:</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather than have such a thing happen, I would have you
boys drown her in the river. And if you would not do it, I
would do it myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne turned pale. Instantly it was borne in upon her
that her father must not know of her mission. She knew that
if now she were to tell of the wonderful task that had been assigned
to her she would not be believed, but that he would
think ill of her.</p>
<p>At this juncture her mother spoke, chidingly:</p>
<p>&#8220;How you talk, Jacques. What a pother to make over a
dream. Come now! eat your breakfast, and think no more
of it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>But Jacques only reiterated his words fiercely:</p>
<p>&#8220;I would drown her rather than have a daughter of mine
among soldiers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne glanced at her brothers, but their countenances were
grave enough now, for they comprehended their father&#8217;s meaning.
A sudden sense of aloofness, of being no longer part and
parcel of her family, smote her. The tears came and overflowed
her cheeks, for she was but a girl after all. To hide her
grief she rose hastily, and ran to her own little room.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>From this time forth Jeanne&#8217;s family could not fail to
notice the change that marked her bearing and appearance.
Her eyes glowed with the light of a steadfast
purpose, and the serene thoughtfulness of her countenance was
illumined by a brightness that was like the rosy flush of dawn
stealing upon the pale coldness of the morning. She was still
simple in manner, but her shrinking timidity had vanished, and
in its stead had come decision and an air of authority. She
bore herself nobly, as became one who had been vested with
the leadership of a divine mission. Yet of this outward expression
of authority she was unconscious. The thought that
filled her to the exclusion of all else was how she was to proceed
to accomplish her task. For there were three things that
she had to do for the saving of her country:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></div>
<p>First: She must go to Robert de Baudricourt at Vaucouleurs.</p>
<p>Second: She must win back France from her enemies.</p>
<p>Third: She must lead the Dauphin to his anointing at
Reims. How these things were to be brought to pass she did
not know.</p>
<p>The walled town of Vaucouleurs lay some twelve miles to
the northward of Domremy, and was the chief place of the
district. Its captain, Robert de Baudricourt, was well known
throughout the Valley of Colors. He was a blunt, practical
man of the sword, who had married two rich widows in succession,
and who had been fighting since he could bear arms, in
the reckless wars of the Lorraine Marches. He was brave
as a lion, coarse, rough, domineering, an ideal soldier of his time
and country. Jacques D&#8217;Arc had had personal dealings with
him in the Spring of the previous year when he had appeared
before him to plead the cause of Domremy against one Guiot
Poignant, and he had many tales to tell of the rough Governor.
How could she approach such a man?</p>
<p>There was no hope of help at home. That she foresaw
clearly as she recalled her father&#8217;s words concerning his dream.
She knew that he would oppose her bitterly. Nor would her
mother aid her, deeply as she loved her, to go contrary to her
father&#8217;s will. Neither would they allow her to journey to
Vaucouleurs unattended. The maiden made a mental review
of the villagers in search of one to whom she might appeal for
assistance, but rejected them sadly as their images passed before
her. Clearly she must bide her time.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I must go soon,&#8221; she mused. &#8220;It is the will of God.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></div>
<p>Just at this juncture, when she knew not to whom to go,
Durand Lassois, a cousin by marriage whom she called uncle
because he was so much older than she, came to Domremy on
a visit. Jeanne hailed his advent with eagerness. He lived
with his young wife, who was Isabeau&#8217;s niece, in Bury le Petit,
a hamlet lying on the left bank of the Meuse in the green
valley, nine miles from Domremy, but only three from Vaucouleurs.
Here was the help that she needed, for Durand was
fond of Jeanne, and would do her bidding as unquestioningly as
a mastiff obeys the child whom he adores.</p>
<p>So when Jeanne, taking him aside, asked him to take her
home with him for a visit to her cousin, his wife, he assented
readily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aveline will be glad for you to come, Jeanne,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;She is not well, and a visit from you will cheer her up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jacques D&#8217;Arc made some objections when the subject was
broached, but Isabeau was pleased and over-ruled them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the very thing,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;The child has been
in need of a change this long while. Nay, now, Jacques, say
naught against it. She shall go. I wonder that we did not
think of sending her there ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be for only a week, then,&#8221; said Jacques.</p>
<p>&#8220;A week is better than nothing,&#8221; spoke Durand Lassois.
&#8220;Have no fear for her, Jacques. She shall be well looked
after.&#8221;</p>
<p>So a few days later the uncle and niece started for Bury
le Petit by way of the hill path beyond Greux. As they walked
through the forest, fragrant with the breath of spring, Jeanne
said abruptly:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Durand, while I am at your house I wish you to
take me to Vaucouleurs to see Sire Robert de Baudricourt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wish me to do what, child?&#8221; he asked in open-mouthed
amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;To take me to Vaucouleurs to see Sire Robert de Baudricourt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; demanded Lassois, staring at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that he may send me to the place where the Dauphin is,
uncle. I must go into France to lead the Dauphin to Reims,
that he may be crowned King there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Into the peasant&#8217;s honest face there came a troubled expression.
Slowly he passed his hand across his brow, then stopped
in the path and looked at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be that we are walking too fast, little one,&#8221; he said
gently. &#8220;Your mother said that you had not been well, and
&#8217;tis known that the sun sometimes plays strange tricks with
the wits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not daft, uncle, nor hath the sun unsettled my wits.&#8221;
Jeanne showed neither surprise nor vexation at his words.
&#8220;Have you not heard that a woman should lose France, and
that a Maid should save France?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard it,&#8221; admitted Durand slowly. &#8220;What then,
Jeanne?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am that Maid, Uncle Durand. I shall save France.&#8221;
She spoke in a tone of quiet conviction.</p>
<p>The man drew a long breath and stared at her. He had
known the maid all her short life. Knew of her good deeds,
her purity and truthfulness; knew that all that could be urged
against her was the fault of going to church too frequently. So
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
now, as he noted the clearness of her eyes and the calmness of
her manner, he told himself that she believed what she said,
and that whatever might be the nature of her affliction it was not
madness.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must believe me, uncle,&#8221; spoke the girl pleadingly,
&#8220;Have I not always been truthful?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so now. I am called of God to win back France from
her enemies, and to lead the Dauphin to be crowned King at
Reims. I go to the Captain of Vaucouleurs that he may grant
men to me to take me to the gentle Dauphin. Will you take
me to Sire Robert?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lassois did not reply. He could not. He stood for a long
moment utterly incapable of speech. Jeanne went on in her
soft, clear accents to tell him of her mission and of its divine
origin. She was so earnest, she spoke with such assurance of
the charge that had been laid upon her that in spite of himself
Durand believed her. To the natural mind the wonder is not
that angelic visitors come to the pure and good, but that they
come so seldom. He leaned forward suddenly, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take you to Vaucouleurs, ma mie, if you wish to go.
Jacques won&#8217;t like it, though. Have you thought of that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, uncle, but it is the will of God. I must go,&#8221; she
told him.</p>
<p>Involuntarily Lassois crossed himself. There was such a
look of exaltation about the maiden that he felt as though he
were in church.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take you, Jeanne,&#8221; he said again. &#8220;But hark ye, child!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
there must be no word of your Voices at the house. Neither
Aveline nor her parents would believe you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be many who will not believe me, uncle,&#8221; sighed
she. She thought of the dear ones at Domremy who would
not, and sighed again. &#8220;Even Sire Robert will not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why go to him?&#8221; he demanded bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is commanded,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Later he will believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the compact was made, and Jeanne had found the way
to make the first step toward the fulfilling of her mission, and
the journey was finished without further incident. However,
it proved not so easy to leave for Vaucouleurs as she supposed
it would be. Lassois and his young wife lived with her parents,
the wife&#8217;s mother being Isabeau&#8217;s sister was therefore Jeanne&#8217;s
aunt. Both mother and daughter welcomed their young kinswoman
with delight, and took such pleasure in her society that
they were unwilling that she should leave them even for a
day. Thus four days went by before Durand was able to fulfill
his promise. It was managed at last, however, and the maiden&#8217;s
heart beat high as they left Bury le Petit behind them, and
set their faces toward Vaucouleurs. Being but a three mile
journey it was quickly made. Though born and bred in the
valley it was the first time that she had ever seen the grim little
fighting town where Robert de Baudricourt upheld the Standard
of the Lilies against that of the Leopard. Therefore she
looked about her with natural curiosity.</p>
<p>The width of the valley lessened here. The hills pressed so
closely upon the river that the meadows lay at the very feet of
the town. Within the walls the buildings clustered round the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
base of a hill upon which stood the castle of the Governor and
the church, overlooking the vast extent of hills and dominating
the valley.</p>
<p>Without difficulty they entered the town, and climbed one
of the narrow streets leading to the castle. The gates were
open, for the bluff Captain was easy of access to his followers
and townsmen. A number of soldiers were scattered about
the courtyard burnishing armour, sharpening swords, and all
as busy and merry as valiant men-at-arms should be. They
cast curious glances at the pair, the rustic countryman and his
fair companion, but on the whole were civil enough, permitting
them to pass without hindrance into an ante-chamber of the
castle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I not speak to Sire Robert first, Jeanne?&#8221; questioned
Lassois, who became all at once awkward and diffident.
Secretly he hoped that the Governor would refuse to see his
young kinswoman. He feared his ridicule. Jeanne shook her
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go together, Uncle Durand. Go thou to thy master,
the Sire Robert,&#8221; she added, turning to the page who now
approached to learn what they wanted, &#8220;and tell him that
Jeanne, the Maid, who comes with her uncle, would speak with
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye must wait,&#8221; spoke the page pertly. &#8220;My master sits at
meat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nathless thou wilt take the message,&#8221; spoke the girl so
firmly and with so much of command that the youth&#8217;s insolent
air became at once respectful. &#8220;My lord&#8217;s business is of importance.
It must be attended to.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>The lad bowed, and left them. Soon he returned, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Sire Captain says that you are to come to him. This
way.&#8221; With this he conducted them through many a windy
passage to the banqueting chamber.</p>
<p>A long table extended its length down the centre of the
room, and around it were gathered the officers of the garrison.
At the far end of this table stood a smaller one elevated above
the other by a dais. At this table with three companions sat a
brawny, gray-haired man whom Jeanne knew at once was
the Governor.</p>
<p>Lassois, shy and ill at ease among so many gentles, stopped
short just inside the door, and stood awkwardly twirling his
cap in his hand. But Jeanne, who had been wont to tremble
and blush before strangers, was in no wise abashed, but with
noble and courteous bearing proceeded directly to the small
table.</p>
<p>An involuntary exclamation of admiration escaped the rough
soldier&#8217;s lips. The girl was clad in the ordinary red homespun
frock of the peasant, and her abundant hair was entirely hidden
under the coif worn by all women, but neither the poor
dress nor the coif could conceal her beauty. So Robert de
Baudricourt&#8217;s tones were as soft as his harsh voice would permit
as he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou art welcome, child. What wouldst thou have with
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am come to you, Sire Robert, sent by Messire,&#8221; she answered
fearlessly, &#8220;that you may send word to the Dauphin and
tell him to hold himself in readiness, but not to give battle to
his enemies.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></div>
<p>A gasp of amazement came from Sire Robert. He did
not speak, but, leaning forward, he regarded the maiden keenly.
With perfect calm and self-possession she continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Before mid Lent my Lord will grant him aid. But in
very deed the realm belongs not to the Dauphin. Nathless
it is Messire&#8217;s will that the Dauphin should be King, and
receive the kingdom in trust. Notwithstanding his enemies
the Dauphin shall be King; and it is I who shall lead him to
his anointing.&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment of silence followed this startling announcement.
Across the faces of the men-at-arms stole expressions of pity,
then a murmur of compassion ran through the room as Sire
Robert asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Messire?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Jeanne answered, &#8220;He is the King of Heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now it happened that just before Lassois and Jeanne entered
the hall the Governor and his men had been discussing the
state of affairs in the country. It was noised about that the
English were preparing for a new attack in force on the
Dauphin&#8217;s territories south of the Loire. It was rumored also
that the little wedge of loyal territory in which Vaucouleurs
lay was to be the object of special attack by the Burgundians.
That a young peasant girl, accompanied by a rustic, should
calmly inform him that she should straighten out the difficulties
of distressed France appealed to Robert as a huge joke.
So, at her answer, he gave way to a great shout of laughter in
which his men, as in duty bound, joined. Sire Robert had
no sentiment, but was possessed of a coarse humour. Again
and again the rafters rang with his merriment. When the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
hilarity had somewhat subsided he beckoned Lassois to draw
near.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come hither, rustic,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is this thy daughter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Durand tremblingly. &#8220;She is the daughter
of Jacques D&#8217;Arc.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So?&#8221; Sire Robert scanned the maid with new interest.
&#8220;See you, my man,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The girl is daft; clean daft.
As witless an innocent as ever it has been my lot to behold.
Whip her well, and send her home to her father.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whip her? Lassois turned a startled glance upon the Governor
as though he had not heard aright. Whip Jeanne, who
was so good and sweet? The very idea was profanation.
Cowed and frightened he grasped the maiden&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Let&#8217;s be going.&#8221;</p>
<p>But calmly, courageously Jeanne faced the Governor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I go, Sire Robert, but I shall come again. For it is you
who are appointed by the will of Messire to send me with an
escort of men-at-arms to the aid of the Dauphin. My Voices
have said so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mad though they deemed the maiden, the men-at-arms and
their Captain were impressed by the girl&#8217;s gravity and noble
bearing as she spoke. In silence, therefore, they permitted the
pair to pass from the room.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>At the end of the week Lassois took Jeanne home. It
was a return fraught with unpleasantness.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s visit to Sire Robert and her claim that
she would lead the Dauphin to his anointing had been discussed
and made a matter of sport by the soldiers of the garrison.
From them it passed to the townspeople; from the
townspeople to the country, and thence to Domremy. The
whole valley buzzed with talk of it. Jacques heard the gossip
in a passion of shame and anger. Therefore, when Lassois
and his daughter entered the cottage he met them with scowling
brow.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this that I hear about your visiting Sire Robert
de Baudricourt?&#8221; he demanded of Jeanne wrathfully. &#8220;Why
did you go there? What business had you with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne faced him bravely.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I had to go,&#8221; she told him calmly. &#8220;It was commanded.
Sire Robert has been appointed to give me men-at-arms to
take me to the Dauphin that I may lead him to his anointing.
I am to save France, father. It is so commanded by Messire,
the King of Heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her father&#8217;s jaw dropped. He stood staring at her for
a long moment, then turned to his wife with a groan.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is out of her senses, Isabeau,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Our daughter&#8217;s
wits are wandering. This comes of so much church going
and prayer. I will have no more of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shame upon you, Jacques, for speaking against the church,&#8221;
exclaimed Isabeau. &#8220;Say rather it hath come from the tales
of bloodshed she hath heard. Too many have been told about
the fireside. &#8217;Tis talk, talk of the war all the time. I warned
you of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever be the cause I will have no more of it,&#8221; reiterated
Jacques with vehemence. &#8220;Nay; nor will I have any more
going to Vaucouleurs, nor talk of seeking the Dauphin. Do
you hear, Jeanne?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, father,&#8221; she answered quietly. &#8220;I grieve to go against
your will, but I must do the work the Lord has appointed.
Let me tell you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naught! You shall tell me naught,&#8221; cried Jacques almost
beside himself with rage. &#8220;Go to your room, and stay there for
the rest of the day. And hark ye all!&#8221; including his wife and
sons in a wide sweeping gesture, &#8220;wherever Jeanne goes one of
you must be with her. See to it. At any time she may go
off with some roaming band of Free Lances. Rather than have
that happen I would rather she were dead.&#8221; He turned upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
Lassois fiercely as Jeanne, weeping bitterly at his harsh words,
obediently withdrew into her own little room.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you, Lassois! why did you not keep her from going
to Vaucouleurs? You knew that I would not like it. You
knew also that it would cause talk. Why, why did you permit
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, I knew all that, Jacques,&#8221; responded Lassois, shifting
uneasily from one foot to the other. &#8220;But Jeanne really believed
that she had received a divine command to go to Sire
Robert. So believing, she would have gone to him in spite of
all that I could have done. Therefore, was it not better that I
should take her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Durand speaks truly, Jacques,&#8221; spoke Isabeau. &#8220;The
child is clearly daft. I have heard that such are always set in
their fancies. What is past, is past. She has been to Vaucouleurs;
therefore, it can not be undone. What remains to be
done is to guard against any future wanderings.&#8221; The mother
was as greatly distressed as the father, but out of sympathy
for his woe she forced herself to speak of the occurrence with
calmness.</p>
<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; muttered Jacques. &#8220;True. No doubt you could
not do other than you did, Durand; but I wonder that you did
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne does not seem out of her senses to me,&#8221; observed
Lassois. &#8220;There is a saying, as you well know, that a maid
from the Bois Chesnu shall redeem France. It might be she
as well as another. She is holy enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pouf!&#8221; Jacques snapped his fingers derisively. &#8220;It is
as Isabeau says: she has heard too much of the state of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
realm, and of the wonderful Maid who is to restore it. The
country is full of the talk. It could not mean her. She is but
a peasant girl, and when hath a villein&#8217;s daughter ever ridden a
horse, or couched a lance? Let her keep to her station. Don&#8217;t
let such wild talk addle your wits, too, Durand. Now tell me
everything that occurred at Vaucouleurs. The village rings
with the affair. I want the whole truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lassois did as requested, and told all of the happening.
Finding the girl&#8217;s parents so incredulous concerning her mission
had somewhat shaken his belief in his niece, but the germ
that remained caused him to soften the narrative a little.
Jacques heard him through in silence. When Durand had finished
the telling he bowed his head upon his arms as though
the recital were beyond his strength to bear.</p>
<p>He was an upright man, just and honorable in his dealings
with others. He stood well in the village, being esteemed
next to the mayor himself. He was fond of his children, and
had looked after their upbringing strictly. He wanted nothing
out of the ordinary, nothing unusual, nothing but what
was conventional and right to occur among them. He did not
believe that his daughter had received a divine command. He
did not know of her Heavenly visitants, nor would he have
believed in them had he known. He thought that someway,
somehow, she had become imbued with a wild fancy to be among
men-at-arms; that, in consequence, she might become a worthless
creature. The mere idea was agony. After a time he
raised his head to ask brokenly,</p>
<p>&#8220;She told the Sire Captain that she would come again, Durand?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Jacques. She believes that she has been commanded
so to do. She told you that; and whatever Jeanne thinks is
the will of God that she will do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She deludes herself,&#8221; spoke the father shortly, detecting the
hint of faith underlying Lassois&#8217; tone. &#8220;Think you that the
Governor would listen to her if she were to go to him again?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lassois reflected.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said presently. &#8220;I think he will not pay any attention
to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jacques brightened. &#8220;That is well,&#8221; he nodded. &#8220;She
shall not go if I can prevent it. She shall be guarded well. I
shall see to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereafter a strict watch was kept upon Jeanne&#8217;s every
movement. One of her brothers, or Jacques D&#8217;Arc himself,
was always with her. Instead of the tenderness that her father
had always shown toward her there was now harshness and
severity. Her mother too, though far from being cruel, was
querulous and often spoke sharply to her. Isabeau knew her
child&#8217;s pure heart too well to believe that the girl was actuated
by any but the highest motives. She did think, however, that
the child&#8217;s wits wandered, though the maiden performed her
customary duties with care and exactness, and was worried and
distressed in consequence.</p>
<p>In the village Jeanne found herself avoided. With the exception
of Mengette and Hauviette her friends shunned her.
The little hamlet was in a ferment of tattle. Whenever she
appeared in any of the narrow streets heads were bent together
and fingers pointed mockingly. Often the whispers reached
her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There goes she who is to save France.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne D&#8217;Arc says she is to lead the Dauphin to his anointing.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a trying time. Jeanne often shed tears over the jeers
and taunts, but she wept in secret. Outwardly serene she submitted
meekly to the espionage of her own people, and to the
gibes of her neighbors. Had it not been for the consolation
received from &#8220;Her Voices,&#8221; life would have been unendurable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be patient, Daughter of God,&#8221; they said. &#8220;It will not be
long. All will be well. Thy time will come soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father grieves over you, Jeanne,&#8221; spoke Isabeau one
day after Jacques, stung beyond endurance by some remark he
had heard against his daughter, was taking her severely to
task. &#8220;He is cut to the heart that you should have gone to
Vaucouleurs, and by your talk of the Dauphin. You must not
be angry with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not, mother,&#8221; said the maiden sadly. &#8220;I know that he
does not understand. Nor do you; but you will&ndash;&ndash;in time.&#8221;
She loved her parents dearly, and excused their rigorousness
because she knew that they did not believe in her inspiration.
Often had she tried to explain matters, but they would not
listen.</p>
<p>&#8220;We understand only too well, little one,&#8221; responded Isabeau.
&#8220;Jacques fears that you are bent upon seeking Sire
Robert again. I have told him that you will not.&#8221; She gave
Jeanne a questioning glance as she finished speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must, mother. It is commanded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne, give o&#8217;er such talk,&#8221; exclaimed her mother sharply.
&#8220;Where did you get such notions? The neighbors say that you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
got your affliction at l&#8217;Arbre-des-F&eacute;es. That you have been
seen there alone, bewreathing the tree with garlands, and that
while so doing you met a wicked fairy who was your fate. Is
it true?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there be fairies, mother, I have never seen them, and
not in years have I carried wreaths to l&#8217;Arbre-des-F&eacute;es. I
used to go there on Laetare Sunday with the boys and girls,
but I go no longer. As to flowers, mother; I carry them only
to the altar of Our Lady of Belmont, or offer them here to the
Saints.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is naught but good in that, so what makes the people
talk so?&#8221; ejaculated the mother fretfully. &#8220;If you would
but give up your talk of helping the Dauphin this tittle-tattle
might be stopped. As it is, Jacques is distressed that you are
so obdurate. He spoke to the Cur&eacute; about exorcising you for
the evil spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, did my father do that?&#8221; exclaimed the girl, the
tears springing to her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it is not to be.&#8221; The good dame herself had not approved
this measure. She was in truth almost as much exercised
over her husband as she was over her daughter. &#8220;Messire
Guillaume Frontey would not hear of it, saying, that whatever
might be the state of your wits your soul was as pure as a lily,
because he confessed you almost daily. I advised Jacques&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
Isabeau paused and subjected her daughter to a keen scrutiny,
scarcely knowing how to proceed. She was in truth puzzled
and a little awed by Jeanne&#8217;s new attitude and demeanor.
Presently she continued abruptly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I was married when I was your age, Jeanne.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Were you, mother?&#8221; A slight smile stirred the corners
of the girl&#8217;s mouth. She saw what was coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and Mengette hath been betrothed since Eastertide.
She is to be married after the harvest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She told me, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And of all of the girls of your age you and Hauviette alone
remain unplighted. Hauviette hath the excuse of being a
little young, but you&ndash;&ndash;you are sixteen, and quite old enough
for a home and a husband, Jeanne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221; There was such appeal in the maiden&#8217;s voice
that Isabeau, deeming it caused by the suddenness of the
announcement, turned quickly with outstretched hands.
&#8220;You must not talk of marriage to me. I shall remain
unwed until my task is finished. I have vowed it to &#8216;My
Voices.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pouf, child! A home of your own, and a husband to look
after will soon make you forget such notions, and so I told
Jacques. Come now, be reasonable! I know some one who
would gladly provide such a home. Let&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;While France writhes in agony under the heel of the invader
there shall be no marriage for me,&#8221; spoke Jeanne firmly,
turning to leave the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nathless, whether you like it or not, you shall be married,&#8221;
cried Isabeau, nettled by the girl&#8217;s words. &#8220;Your father has
determined on it. Your plighted husband comes this evening
to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne stood aghast. She had not dreamed that her parents
would go so far. She stood for a moment without speaking,
then she said quietly:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>&#8220;My faith is plighted to none but my Lord. No man has it,
nor shall have it until Messire&#8217;s mission is completed. &#8217;Tis
useless to speak of it.&#8221; Again she started to leave the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nathless, Colin de Greux will be here this evening,&#8221; exclaimed
Isabeau thoroughly out of patience.</p>
<p>Colin? The merry nature that lay under Jeanne&#8217;s gravity
surged upward, and a twinkle came into her eyes. All at once
she laughed outright. Her mother glanced at her quickly,
surprised and relieved.</p>
<p>&#8220;There! That&#8217;s better,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He will be here after
supper, Jeanne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It matters not, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isabeau&#8217;s relief changed to perplexity at the words. There
was something in the tone that did not satisfy her, but as it was
nearer to an affirmative than she had hoped for she was fain
to make the best of the matter; so made no further remark.</p>
<p>Colin de Greux came with the evening. He had grown tall
with the years, and was not ill looking. He was still the same
easy-going, lumbering, dull sort of fellow whose good opinion
of himself rendered him impervious to rebuffs or coldness. He
was not the youth that ordinarily Isabeau would have chosen
for her child, but Jeanne had never encouraged attentions from
the village lads, who now fought shy of her because of her
extreme piety. Desperate diseases require desperate remedies.
Jacques and Isabeau judged that marriage even with Colin
was better than the fancies that filled their daughter&#8217;s mind.
Beside, where another might be easily repulsed Colin could
be induced to continue his wooing. Jeanne saw through this
reasoning. She determined to make short shrift of Colin.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>When the evening came, therefore, she took a hoe and went
into the garden. Colin found her there industriously at work
among the artichokes.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Jeanne?&#8221; he said sheepishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well indeed, Colin.&#8221; Jeanne wielded the hoe vigorously,
and gave no indication of quitting her seemingly absorbing
task.</p>
<p>There came a silence. Had they been with the sheep on
the uplands Colin would have been thoroughly at ease. As
it was there was something about the maiden&#8217;s manner that
disturbed his assurance. He had not been wont to feel so in
her presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s warm out here,&#8221; he ventured presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perchance you will find it cooler in the house,&#8221; intimated
the girl sweetly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The family will be there,&#8221; he objected, looking suggestively
at a bench under an apple tree. The youths and the maidens
of Domremy always sat together when the suitor was approved
by the parents. Jeanne&#8217;s cool, steadfast gaze disconcerted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, Colin, they will be there. You will find them all,
I think. Jean and Pierre are with mother. Did you wish to
see them?&#8221;</p>
<p>This roused Colin.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I don&#8217;t wish to see them,&#8221; he said angrily. &#8220;I wish
to talk to you, Jeanne D&#8217;Arc.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am listening, Colin.&#8221; Jeanne quietly finished the hill
which she was hoeing, then began on the next row, which was
further removed from the youth, the tall heads of the artichokes
nodding stiffly between them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t talk while you are hoeing,&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;And your father told me that I might talk to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne laid down the hoe, and confronted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Colin,&#8221; she said gravely, &#8220;mother told me that you would
come, and why; but it is of no use. There are other girls in the
village who would gladly marry you. I am resolved not to
wed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any other girl for a wife but you, Jeanne. I
have always liked you, and you know it. Besides, your
father&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot wed a girl against her will, Colin, and I shall
not marry you. I am talking plainly, so that you will understand,
and not waste your time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you shall,&#8221; muttered the boy wrathfully. &#8220;Your father
tells me that you shall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a word Jeanne turned from him, and flitted swiftly
into the church. It was her sanctuary, for Isabeau would not
allow her devotions to be interrupted. Sulkily Colin re-entered
the cottage.</p>
<p>Urged on by the girl&#8217;s parents, he was thereafter a frequent
visitor, but his wooing did not speed. Somehow all his pretty
speeches, all his self-assurance shriveled into nothingness when
he was face to face with Jeanne. And serenely the maiden
went her way, ignoring alike her father&#8217;s mandates, and her
mother&#8217;s entreaties to marry the lad.</p>
<p>So sped the days.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>So the days sped. Presently rumours of another and
more startling nature ran through the valley. Interest
in Jeanne D&#8217;Arc, her mission, and Colin&#8217;s wooing
paled before the news. It was noised that Antoine de Vergy,
Governor of Champagne, had received a commission from the
Duke of Bedford, Regent of France for Henry VI, to furnish
forth men-at-arms for the purpose of bringing the castellany of
Vaucouleurs into subjection to the English. The greatest
alarm prevailed when the report was confirmed, that the Governor
had in truth set forth. On the march, as was his custom,
Antoine de Vergy laid waste all the villages of the loyal
little wedge of territory with fire and sword. Domremy with
its adjoining village of Greux lay in the southern part of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
castellany, between Bar and Champagne, and was therefore
directly in the line of attack. Threatened again with a disaster
with which they were only too well acquainted the folk of the
two villages met in solemn conclave to determine what was to
be done.</p>
<p>Men, women and children were in the assembly that had
gathered before the little church to discuss the situation; their
pale faces showing plainly that they realized to the full the
calamity that menaced them. Life, liberty and property were
all at stake, for everything would be swept away by the ravaging
Antoine. The very imminence of the danger rendered
them calm, but it was the calmness of despair. Resistance to
the force that was with Antoine was out of the question, so
what could they do?</p>
<p>&#8220;And why not retire to the Castle of the Island, my children?&#8221;
queried Messire Guillaume Frontey, Cur&eacute; of Domremy.
&#8220;Surely, it hath proved a good refuge in other times
of need. Is it not a secure stronghold?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We fear not, father,&#8221; responded a peasant. &#8220;Sire Antoine
boasts that we can not hold it against him, as he knows of
a secret passage whereby he can obtain entrance when he so
chooses. We have made search for the passageway, but we
cannot find it; though it is known to exist, for there be some in
the village who have heard of it. Against others we can hold
the castle; against him we fear to try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then may Our Lady preserve ye, my children,&#8221; exclaimed
the priest solemnly. &#8220;What can be done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; cried Jacques D&#8217;Arc, suddenly elbowing his way
through the people until he stood by the Cur&eacute;&#8217;s side in full
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
view of every one. &#8220;This, father, and friends: let us, as we
fear to try the castle, gather our furniture in carts; then, driving
our cattle and sheep before us, go to Neufch&acirc;teau which, being
a town of Lorraine, will not be attacked. As you know, though
it be a Burgundian belonging, its sympathies are with the
Armagnacs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, Jacques!&#8221; &#8220;Well said!&#8221; came from the villagers
in a chorus of approval. &#8220;When shall we go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better to-day than to-morrow, friends,&#8221; shouted Jacques.
&#8220;Better now than later. We know not when they will be
upon us.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were cries of, &#8220;Right, Jacques!&#8221; followed by a hasty
dispersal of the people to gather up their goods and cattle. A
scene of disorder and confusion ensued as men and boys ran to
the fields for the flocks and herds, which were quickly driven
into the highroad, and women and girls stripped their linen
chests and cupboards, and hurriedly piled their furnishings into
ox carts.</p>
<p>Isabeau was weeping as she worked, for she might find the
cottage burned and the village devastated upon her return.
She had always known war. Her mother and her mother&#8217;s
mother had known it. For ninety-one years it had raged, and
the end was not yet. France was a wreck, a ruin, a desolation.
Throughout the land there was nothing but pillage, robbery,
murder, cruel tyranny, the burning of churches and abbeys, and
the perpetration of horrible crimes. Seeing her grief Jeanne
went to her mother, and put her arms about her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be not so sorrowful, mother,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Before many
years are sped the war will have come to an end. And this is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
the last time that you will have to flee from the cottage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isabeau brushed away her tears and looked at her daughter
steadily. &#8220;Why do you speak so, Jeanne?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;It is
as though you knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, mother; I know. It will be as I say. And now let&#8217;s
get the rest of the furniture in the cart. Father grows impatient.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curiously enough, Isabeau was comforted. She dried her
eyes and gave way to grief no more. Jacques came in and seeing
Jeanne so helpful, bringing order out of the chaos about
her, spoke gently to her in quite his old tender manner. So
that Jeanne&#8217;s heart was lighter than it had been since her return
from Bury le Petit. The animals were in the highroad,
the ox carts were drawn up behind them laden with the belongings
of the villagers, the women and children stood ready,
waiting for the word of departure to be given, to take up the
line of march to Neufch&acirc;teau, when they were thrown into the
greatest confusion by the advent of a man-at-arms who rode
among them at speed, crying:</p>
<p>&#8220;March! March while there is time. Vaucouleurs is attacked,
and Sire Antoine hath started a body of men this
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was gone before the startled villagers had time to question
him. For a time the greatest excitement prevailed, but
something like order was restored at length, and with lingering,
despairing looks at the homes they were abandoning the village
folk started toward Neufch&acirc;teau, their market town, lying five
miles to the southward of Domremy. The day was excessively
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
warm, and wearily the village folk followed the road through
fields of wheat and rye, up the vine clad hills to the town.
There were many of them, and their chattels were numerous,
but the citizens received them cordially and lodged them as best
they could.</p>
<p>Jacques conducted his family at once to the inn kept by a
worthy woman, La Rousse by name, whom he knew. The
move from Domremy had been made none too soon, for Antoine
de Vergy&#8217;s men swept into the village but a few hours after
the departure of its inhabitants, and both Domremy and Greux
were laid waste.</p>
<p>To Jeanne the days that followed were tranquil and the
happiest that she had known for a long time. As in Domremy
she drove her father&#8217;s beasts to the fields, and kept his flocks.
She also helped La Rousse about the household duties, greatly
to the good dame&#8217;s satisfaction, and when she was not helping
her hostess, or tending the cattle she passed all her time in
church.</p>
<p>During the first few days of the stay in the market town
Jeanne saw Colin frequently, but greatly to her relief he forbore
to press his attentions upon her. Then she saw him
no longer, and rejoiced thereat. Her thanksgiving was of
short duration.</p>
<p>Dinner was over in the common room of the inn one day,
and the guests&ndash;&ndash;not numerous as it chanced&ndash;&ndash;had broken up
into groups; some lingering at the board where they had eaten,
others clustering at small tables scattered about the rush
strewn room. The great chamber, with its dusky walls and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
blackened beams would have looked gloomy enough on a dark
day, but the heat and bright sunshine of midsummer made it
seem cool and restful.</p>
<p>In the nook formed by the outer angle of the huge projecting
chimney, and so somewhat in the shadow, sat Jeanne waiting
for the guests to leave the board that she might clear away the
dinner. Her father and a man with whom he was conversing
were the last ones to rise, and at once the girl came forward
to begin her task. As she did so there came the sound of a
dagger hilt beating upon the outside door at the further end
of the room. Before Jeanne could reach it to open it the
heavy door swung open quickly as though thrust inward by a
strong hasty hand, and there entered a man garbed in priest&#8217;s
raiment. Reverent always in her attitude toward priests the
maiden bowed low before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it your pleasure to have dinner, messire?&#8221; she asked
when she had risen from her obeisance.</p>
<p>&#8220;In due time, my child,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;But first, I would
speak with a pucelle who is here. One Jeanne, daughter of
Jacques D&#8217;Arc.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am she,&#8221; spoke the maiden in astonishment. &#8220;What
would you of me, messire?&#8221;</p>
<p>At this juncture Isabeau, accompanied by La Rousse, entered
the room. The latter hastened forward to welcome the
newcomer when she paused, arrested by his words:</p>
<p>&#8220;I come from the Bishop of Toul, Judge of the Ecclesiastical
Court having jurisdiction over Domremy and Greux. He
cites thee, Jeanne, daughter of Jacques D&#8217;Arc, to appear before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
him to show cause why thou dost not fulfill thy plighted
troth to Colin de Greux.&#8221;</p>
<p>Throughout the long chamber there was a stir and murmur
at the words, for Jeanne had become liked and esteemed by
the guests, who had heard something of Colin&#8217;s wooing. La
Rousse went to her in quick sympathy, for the girl stood dumbfounded.</p>
<p>So this was what Colin had been about in his absence? And
her parents? Were they too concerned in the matter? She
turned and looked at them searchingly. Isabeau could not
meet her daughter&#8217;s eyes, but Jacques met her glance steadily.
Long father and daughter gazed into each other&#8217;s eyes;
Jeanne, with sorrowful reproach; Jacques with grim determination.
Then slowly the girl turned again to the priest.</p>
<p>&#8220;When does messire, the bishop, wish to see me?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The second day from now, pucelle. If upon that day
cause is not shown why thy pledge to Colin should not be kept
the judge will deem that the troth stands, and that thy faith
will be redeemed at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne inclined her head deeply in acknowledgment, and
started to leave the room. Isabeau ran to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is for thy good, little one. Now will you be ever near
us. And Colin will make a kind husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>So spake Isabeau, but Jeanne made no reply. As she passed
through the door she heard her mother say:</p>
<p>&#8220;She is as good as married, Jacques. She is too shy, too
gentle to protest against it. She will do whatever the bishop
decides without question.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Be not too sure of that,&#8221; spoke La Rousse before Jacques
could reply. &#8220;These gentle maids have a way of turning at
times, and Jeanne doth not lack spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She hath ever been obedient, and will be now,&#8221; said
Jacques confidently. &#8220;Save for this wild fancy of going to the
Dauphin she hath ever been most dutiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes the gentlest maid will turn if pressed too hard,&#8221;
repeated La Rousse.</p>
<p>And this was exactly what was happening. Jeanne was
filled with sorrow that her parents should uphold Colin in
trying to force her into an unwelcome marriage. For a brief
time despair gripped her, for it was foreign to her nature and
training to protest against those in authority over her, and
should the judge sustain Colin it would mean the end of her
mission. And then her soul rose up against it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not be forced into this marriage,&#8221; she decided suddenly.
&#8220;I will go to Toul, and tell messire, the bishop, the
truth of the matter. I will go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go, Daughter of God, and fear naught,&#8221; came the sweet
tones of &#8220;Her Voices.&#8221; &#8220;Fear naught, for we will aid thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the morning broke Jeanne rose to prepare for her
journey. She knew that at this time the great gates of the
archway leading into the courtyard of the inn would be closed,
but there was a door, a small one used privately by La Rousse,
that opened directly into the street. It was at the back of
the inn, and unobserved Jeanne reached it, and passed out. It
was ten leagues from Neufch&acirc;teau to Toul, and thirty miles
was a long journey for a young girl to undertake alone and
on foot. Also the distance lay back through the district over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
which Antoine de Vergy&#8217;s men had swept with fire and sword.
Roving bands of armed men might be encountered, but Jeanne&#8217;s
gentle nature had attained the courage of desperation. She
feared the marriage more than aught else, and were the action
not protested there would be no evading it. So, upheld by
the knowledge that her saints were with her, and an innocence
that was heroic, she made the journey. In perfect
safety she came at last in the dusk of the evening to Toul
in Lorraine, footsore and weary, but with a heart serene and
peaceful.</p>
<p>There were many churches in the old town, and, as was
her custom, she at once sought a chapel and prostrated herself
before the image of the Virgin Mother. Her orisons ended,
she went forth in search of food and lodging. Jeanne being
a peasant girl had not the wherewithal to pay her way, and
so could not go to an inn. But when the condition of the
land was such that townspeople themselves might become
refugees should their towns be overcome by an enemy its denizens
welcomed wayfarers warmly. So Jeanne soon found
shelter with humble folk, and, as she was never idle wherever
she might be, she gladdened the heart of the dame by helping
about the house and spinning. And the next morning she went
to the law courts.</p>
<p>Colin was already in the chapel, where the bishop was sitting.
His self-satisfied expression gave place to one of surprise
at sight of Jeanne, for he had supposed that she would
not appear to contest the action. There were many of the
Domremy people present also, brought hither as Colin&#8217;s witnesses.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<p>Colin declared that Jeanne had been betrothed to him since
childhood, and the maiden was much amazed when the villagers
affirmed after him that they knew such an engagement
existed. After they had spoken the bishop turned to
the girl kindly and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;And where is thy counsel, my child?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have none, messire.&#8221; Jeanne raised her grave eyes to
the kind ones bent upon her. Eyes that were alight with purity
and truthfulness. &#8220;I need none. I have but to speak the
truth; have I not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is all; but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; The judge paused and regarded the
slender maiden attentively. She was unlike a peasant maid,
both in bearing and appearance. Winning and beautiful in
the fresh bloom of young maidenhood, she had not the manner
of a maiden who would plight her word, and then disregard it.
&#8220;Proceed, advocate,&#8221; he said suddenly. &#8220;Let her take the
oath. Swear, my child, with both hands upon the Gospels,
that you will answer true to the questions that will be asked
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>And kneeling before him Jeanne laid her small hands upon
the missal, and said simply:</p>
<p>&#8220;I swear, messire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she answered concerning her name, her country, her
parents, her godfathers and godmothers.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, my child, tell me about this promise of marriage
to Colin de Greux,&#8221; spoke the bishop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Messire, I never promised to marry him,&#8221; she answered
earnestly. &#8220;I have plighted my faith to no man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you witnesses to prove this?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There are my friends and neighbors, messire. They will
answer for this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The judge leaned forward quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have spoken against you, child. Didst not hear them
say that they knew of your engagement to Colin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, messire; but I would question them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is your right.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, one by one, they were recalled to the stand while Jeanne
asked of each three questions:</p>
<p>Had he seen her at any of the dances or merry-makings
with Colin?</p>
<p>Had he seen her at church, or any public place with Colin?</p>
<p>Had he ever heard her, Jeanne, speak of being engaged to
Colin?</p>
<p>To these questions the witnesses were obliged to answer in
the negative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Messire, would I not, were I betrothed to this man, go
abroad with him to church, to dances, or to other public places?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would seem so, my child; but, unless there were cause
why should he take this action?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have ever, messire, found my greatest happiness in going
to church, and in prayer. For this reason I have received a
command from my Lord, the King of Heaven, to perform a
certain task. In pursuance of that command I went to Sire
Robert de Baudricourt of Vaucouleurs to deliver to him a
message. Because of this journey my parents, who do not believe
in my mission, thought that my senses were wandering,
and conceived the idea that to cure my fancies a marriage would
be a good thing.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Therefore, with their encouragement Colin came. Messire,
the first time that he did so I told him that it was of no use, for
marry him I would not. Neither him nor another. Did I
not, Colin?&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned to the youth so quickly, asking the question with
such abruptness, gazing steadily at him the while, that Colin,
taken unawares, nodded affirmation unthinkingly. The bishop
spoke instantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Colin de Greux,&#8221; said he with sternness, &#8220;this maiden speaks
with the sound of truth. It is our opinion that she hath given
no promise. Therefore, do you make oath again, and say
whether it was from this maiden, or from her parents that you
received her faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was from her parents,&#8221; confessed the youth sullenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And not from the maid at all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, messire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The girl hath then plighted no faith to you, and action
against her is dismissed. You, young man, and her parents
also would do well to let the marvellous child alone. The
damsel is simple, good and pious. Nor do I find that her wits
wander, for without advocate, or witnesses she hath established
her case. Go in peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne thanked him with tears, and with full heart returned
to her abiding place. She had worsted Colin, and set at naught
her parents&#8217; wishes by so doing. How would they receive her?</p>
<p>Filled with this thought she trudged the thirty miles back
to Neufch&acirc;teau.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>To Jeanne&#8217;s surprise she was welcomed warmly. Certain
of the Domremy people who had been Colin&#8217;s witnesses
preceded her into Neufch&acirc;teau, and by the time she arrived
all the village folk were cognizant of what had occurred.
A reaction in her favor had set in; for, not only had she conducted
her case without any aid whatsoever, but the bishop had
commended her, and had spoken sharply to Colin, who now became
the laughing stock of his neighbors. All the world loves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
a lover, but it has only contempt for the suitor who brings
ridicule upon either himself or his beloved.</p>
<p>Isabeau folded her daughter in her arms, holding her close
to her heart and shuddering at the thought of the perilous
journey the child had made rather than submit to an unwelcome
marriage; while Jacques, moved out of his usual taciturnity,
spoke to her with something of pride in his tones. For
the first time it occurred to these good people that their daughter
differed from other village maidens, and therefore required
dissimilar treatment. More than once Jeanne found her parents
regarding her with curious, puzzled looks, as though they
wondered if she were in very truth their daughter.</p>
<p>La Rousse openly rejoiced at the outcome of the affair,
and wished the maiden to remain with her indefinitely. But
to this neither Jeanne or her parents would consent. And,
after a fortnight&#8217;s stay, the family returned to Domremy.</p>
<p>Antoine de Vergy had done the work of despoliation thoroughly.
Incensed because the villeins had fled with their cattle
and belongings, thereby depriving him of booty and ransom
which he could not exact from the chief men of the village by
reason of their flight, he had ravaged and burned with more
than his usual fury. The crops were entirely destroyed; the
monastery, once as proud as a fortress with its square watchman&#8217;s
tower, was now nothing but a heap of blackened ruins;
the church also was burned, so that the Domremy folk must
needs go to the church at Greux to hear mass; and but few
cottages were left standing. But the people had their flocks
and herds, and their house furnishings; then too it was summer;
so, bravely, with the patience engendered by long suffering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
they set to work once more to rebuild, rethatch, and repair their
homes. As before, they lived in the castle while the work went
on.</p>
<p>A veritable reign of terror was in all the region about. The
misery and discomfort were inconceivable; yet somehow life
went on. So the Summer waned, and with the first days of
Autumn came the dire intelligence that Orl&eacute;ans, the strong independent
old city sometimes called the key of the Loire, was
besieged by the English. Should it fall France could not be
saved.</p>
<p>The English acted badly in laying siege to the town of
Orl&eacute;ans, for it belonged to Duke Charles, who had been a
prisoner in their hands since the battle of Agincourt. Having
possession of his body they ought to have respected his property,
as was the custom. This conduct was regarded as unprecedented
treachery, and Domremy buzzed with talk as pilgrims
related tales of what was occurring. The English had
built, it was said, fortified towers around the city, the very heart
of France; and entrenched themselves there in great strength.
The Tourelles were taken already, and the city was so invested
that its inhabitants were starving.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such a thing is unheard of,&#8221; declared Jacques in the privacy
of the cottage. &#8220;It is a deed unknown among the very
Saracens. Who could guess that lords and knights of the
Christian faith, holding captive the gentle Duke of Orl&eacute;ans,
would besiege his own city? The leaguer is a great villainy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The leaguer is a great villainy.&#8221; Jeanne repeated the
words to herself, for the tidings of the siege were of the saddest
to her. Her attachment to all the Royal House was strong,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
and especially so to the captive poet. Sorrowfully she sought
comfort from her &#8220;Voices&#8221; who loved the Land of the Lilies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have no fear, Daughter of God,&#8221; they said consolingly.
&#8220;Orl&eacute;ans shall be delivered, and by thee. Thy time is at hand.
Go into France, and raise the siege which is being made before
the city. Go, Daughter of God. Go!&#8221;</p>
<p>So they urged continually. But again the valley was
shrouded in the cold white garb of winter, and still there seemed
no way for her to leave the village. Over her girl heart hung
the dread of leaving home and friends, though never once did
she falter in her purpose. She was steadfast to that. The
yoke of obedience always strong in the mind of a French maiden
would not permit her lightly to disobey her parents. Jeanne
was much troubled over it. They would never give consent.
If she went she must go without it. No longer did they keep
watch over her. Jacques had been more considerate of his
daughter since she had shown herself capable of such resistance
as she had given against Colin. Then too the raid of de
Vergy&#8217;s men-at-arms, the flight to Neufch&acirc;teau with the after
effects, and now the consternation felt by all loyal Frenchmen
over the news of Orl&eacute;ans&#8217; plight; these things had driven all
thought of Jeanne&#8217;s fancy from their minds. She had been so
dutiful, had submitted so sweetly to the espionage, and had
shown no disposition to return to Vaucouleurs even though the
journey to Toul had provided opportunity for it had she been
so minded, that the parents no longer regarded such a journey
as a possibility. Jeanne knew all this.</p>
<p>But they knew that she still had her purpose in mind, for
the maiden had talked freely about it. Jeanne knew what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
she had to do, and longed to be about it. Again and again
she sought help from her &#8220;Voices.&#8221; They became peremptory
in their commands, absolving her from the obedience due her
parents. God&#8217;s command was higher, and this she must obey.
So, certain as to her mission, she was inaccessible either to
remonstrance or appeal. Now she looked about for means to
accomplish her purpose.</p>
<p>The Old Year glided into the vale of discarded years, and
the New Year ushered in January of 1429, which brought
Jeanne&#8217;s seventeenth birthday. The sixth was cold and stormy,
but if it was bleak and wintry without, within the cottage it was
cheery and comfortable. The family gathered around a great
fire of faggots on the afternoon of that day, each one busied
with homely, needful work. Jacques and his eldest son,
Jacquemin, were mending harness; Jean and Pierre were shelling
corn against the next feed of the cattle; little Catherine, as
she was still called, was polishing the copper and pewter on
the dresser, while Jeanne and her mother sewed and spun
alternately. All at once the crunching of wheels on the frosty
snow was heard, followed shortly by a loud &#8220;Hallo!&#8221; as a
vehicle stopped before the door. Jacques laid down his work
with an exclamation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now who can it be that fares forth in such weather to go
visiting?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Open the door, Pierre, and see who is
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jeanne was already at the door before her father had
finished speaking, and opened it wide to the visitor. She gave
an ejaculation of joy as she saw who stood without.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, Uncle Durand,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You look cold.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And feel also, ma mie.&#8221; Lassois made at once for the great
fire. &#8220;Jacques, man, you have cause to be thankful that you
need not fare from the fireside on such a day as this. Pierre,
will you see to the oxen? The poor brutes are well nigh frozen,
and so am I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye look it, Durand,&#8221; spoke Jacques. &#8220;There! come nearer
to the fire. Isabeau, a hot drink will warm his vitals. Welcome,
Lassois, welcome! &#8217;Tis a cold day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; agreed Durand, rubbing his hands before the blaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how is Aveline?&#8221; asked Isabeau, as she placed a hot
drink before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is not well, Isabeau, and the baby is peevish. It is that
that brings me here to-day. Her father hath been taken with
a distemper, and her mother is all taken up in looking after
him. So Aveline wishes that Jeanne might come to stay for a
short time. Will you let her go, Jacques?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne listened anxiously for her father&#8217;s answer. She did
not believe that he would give consent. Indeed Jacques was
silent a long time before he made reply, but at length he said
slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I see no harm in her going, Lassois. It hath been dreary
here this winter, and the work heavy. She may go and stay
with you three weeks, since Aveline is ailing. That is, if her
mother is willing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; spoke Isabeau quickly. &#8220;With a young baby
Aveline needs some one with her to look after things. And
it will give Jeanne a chance to hear the news. I doubt not
but that Aveline will have much to tell her that will be of interest.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>Jeanne was amazed at the readiness with which the consent
was given. She had not thought they would let her go, and
it caused her wonder. But certainly they could not suppose
that she would seek Robert de Baudricourt a second time, or
perhaps Jacques relied upon Sire Robert&#8217;s good sense to send
her home if she should seek him. So it was arranged that the
maiden should return with Lassois to Bury le Petit the next
day.</p>
<p>There was little sleep for the young girl that night. She
knew that it was the last time that she would ever be in her own
home, for she was resolved to go to Vaucouleurs as soon as
Aveline was better. In this she would deliberately disobey
her parents, but there was no other way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would rather be torn apart by wild horses than go against
their wishes,&#8221; she said to herself with tears. &#8220;But God commands
it, and I must go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her destiny called, and she followed the summons. All
earthly ties must be subservient to her great purpose. Suffering
France must be relieved, and it was her mission to give the
aid.</p>
<p>Her time had come.</p>
<p>Therefore her good-byes to her parents, brothers, and little
sister were very tender. She dared not speak of her mission,
and if her loved ones noticed the tenderness of farewells that
so short an absence did not seem to warrant they knew not the
reason for them. So Jeanne passed from her father&#8217;s house,
and climbed into the cart.</p>
<p>Mengette, whose home was near by, was at the window as
Lassois&#8217; cart passed. Jeanne waved to her, crying:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, Mengette. God bless thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>All through the village she saw faces of friends and neighbors
at the windows, or on their doorsteps, and bade them farewell.
But as she drew near the home of Hauviette, and Lassois
stopped for her to call to her friend, Jeanne shook her
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can not speak to her, uncle,&#8221; she said chokingly. &#8220;I
dare not. My heart would fail me, for I love her too dearly
to say good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Greux as they passed through she saw Colin in one of
the narrow streets. Jeanne leaned out of the cart to call
to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, Colin,&#8221; she said. &#8220;God give you good fortune.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; spoke the youth shamefacedly. He
had avoided Jeanne since the meeting at Toul.</p>
<p>&#8220;I go to Vaucouleurs,&#8221; she dared to say. &#8220;Good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Vaucouleurs?&#8221; repeated Lassois, turning to look at her
as they left Colin behind. &#8220;But Aveline, Jeanne?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you think that I would leave her while she has need
of me, Uncle Durand?&#8221; asked the maiden reproachfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Jeanne; I knew that you would not. &#8217;Twas a second
only that I doubted.&#8221; Durand swung his goad over the oxen&#8217;s
backs as he spoke, and the beasts swung into a trot.</p>
<p>But Jeanne turned for a last look at the valley she was leaving
forever. Long she gazed at the red roofs of the village;
at the ice bound river with its rushes rimed with frost; at
the forest, bare and leafless; at the snow covered hills, and
white shrouded meadows; at all the familiar objects hallowed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
by association. Gazed until her tear-blinded eyes would permit
her to look no more.</p>
<p>And so down the Valley of Colors for the last time passed
Jeanne D&#8217;Arc.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>Jeanne stayed at her uncle&#8217;s house with Aveline until
the latter was quite well. Then, there being nothing
further to hinder, she asked Lassois to take her to Vaucouleurs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jacques won&#8217;t like it, Jeanne,&#8221; feebly remonstrated Durand,
knowing full well that notwithstanding the fact he would
do as his niece wished. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t before, you know; and
neither did Isabeau.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go, Uncle Durand. Though I had a hundred fathers,
or a hundred mothers, though I were the daughter of a
King, I still should go. It is commanded.&#8221;</p>
<p>Durand made no further objection, though he knew that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
both Jacques and Isabeau would censure him for yielding to
her. He saw that Jeanne was not to be turned from her purpose,
so made ready for the journey. Perhaps, like Jacques,
he relied on the common sense of the Sire Robert to send the
girl home, for he was cheerful enough when presently they
were on their way to Vaucouleurs.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will return with me, Jeanne? This visit is for the
day only, is it not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, uncle. I shall stay in Vaucouleurs until the Sire Captain
gives me men-at-arms to take me to the Dauphin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if he does not? What then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will in time, Uncle Durand. My Voices have said so,&#8221;
responded the maiden confidently.</p>
<p>Lassois sat for a time without speaking. There was as
much awe as affection in the regard he bore his young kinswoman,
and when she wore a look of exaltation as on this
morning he felt as he did at the ringing of the angelus. But
there was a practical side to the affair to be looked after as
well as a spiritual, and he wished to be able to put the best face
possible on the matter before Jacques; so after a little he
queried:</p>
<p>&#8220;And where shall you bide at Vaucouleurs? Have you
thought of that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, uncle. Mother has a friend, one Catherine le
Royer, who lives in the town. I shall go to her. I am sure
that she will give me welcome for mother&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that is well,&#8221; spoke Lassois in relieved tones. &#8220;I
know Catherine, and her husband also. Henri le Royer, the
wheelwright, he is. Good people they are, and pious.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></div>
<p>By this time they had reached the little walled town nestling
among the low hills of the valley, and again Jeanne passed
up the steep slopes of the hill upon which the castle stood.</p>
<p>As before when she had gone to him Robert de Baudricourt
sat at meat with his captains. There was no smile on his face
this time, however, when, in answer to the request that they
might speak with him Jeanne and her uncle were ushered into
the great dining hall. No smile, though Lassois was awkward
and ill at ease, and Jeanne still wore the red homespun dress,
and the village coif of the peasant. There was not the least
flicker of amusement in his countenance as he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my little maid, what brings thee here this time?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne courtesied low before she replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;My Lord Captain, know that God has commanded me
many times to go to the gentle Dauphin, who must be and who
is the true King of France, that he shall grant me men-at-arms
with whom I shall raise the siege at Orl&eacute;ans, and take him to
his anointing at Reims. And you, Sire Captain, must send or
take me to him. It is commanded.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a long time Robert de Baudricourt sat silent, regarding
the maiden with a troubled look. She was so earnest, was
evidently so sincere in her demand, that he was perplexed.
Was she inspired, or possessed? That was what his expression
said as he gazed at her. If inspired her aid was not to be
despised. If possessed she ought to be dealt with forthwith.
In truth he knew not what to say to her. His own situation
was far from pleasant. When Antoine de Vergy had raged
through the valley the previous Summer he had infested the
town of Vaucouleurs, and de Baudricourt had been obliged to
yield it to him, though he had not yet given possession.</p>

<p>It was one of those capitulations, common in those days, by
which the Commander of a garrison promised to surrender his
fortress by the end of a given time. This promise, however,
ceased to be valid should the fortress be relieved before the day
fixed for its surrender. So Sire Robert&#8217;s own condition was
acute, and if the Dauphin were not in a position to come to
his relief he himself would be caught in the coils of the enemy.
Any promise of deliverance, however humble, was not to be
treated lightly. Therefore, if he did not believe in Jeanne&#8217;s
announcement he at least listened to it readily. At length he
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;This matter should be given some thought, my little maid.
Where do you bide? I would speak with you further concerning
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a stir of surprise among his men, for they noted
with amazement that the Captain addressed the maiden as an
equal.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Catherine le Royer, the wheelwright&#8217;s wife, messire,&#8221;
answered Jeanne.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will speak with you again,&#8221; repeated Sire Robert. And
Jeanne and Lassois, understanding that the interview was
over for this time, withdrew.</p>
<p>Catherine and Henri le Royer were folk of Jeanne&#8217;s own
humble station. The good dame welcomed the girl warmly,
at first for her mother&#8217;s sake and then for her own. Jeanne
had ever a way with women and girls, and but few days had
elapsed ere she had completely won the heart of her hostess by
her gentle ways, her skill in sewing and spinning, and her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
earnest faith. Together they attended mass at the parish
church, spun, sewed, or busied themselves about the house.
Sometimes Jeanne climbed the hill to the royal chapel which
adjoined the Governor&#8217;s castle, for there was a wonderful
image of the Virgin in the crypt of Saint Mary&#8217;s before which
she loved to pray.</p>
<p>News of her mission, the tidings that a young girl was come,
who was appointed by God to save France spread through the
town and surrounding country. The people flocked to see her,
and those who came believed, won by her earnestness and simple
sincerity. They were in no uncertainty at all as to her
mission. A little mob hung about the cottage door to see her
come and go, chiefly to church. The saying, &#8220;France lost by a
woman shall be restored by a maid from the Marches of Lorraine,&#8221;
was on every lip. And the excitement grew.</p>
<p>Again and again Jeanne sought the Governor, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;I must to the gentle Dauphin. It is the will of Messire, the
King of Heaven, that I should wend to the gentle Dauphin.
I am sent by the King of Heaven. I must go even if I go
on my knees. My Lord Captain, in God&#8217;s name, send me to
the gentle Dauphin.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Sire Robert,&ndash;&ndash;though he listened to her readily enough,
and, impressed in spite of himself by her intense fervour, perceived
a certain seriousness in the business,&ndash;&ndash;remained deaf to
her pleadings. He could not believe. What, a young girl
fair and lovely as was this peasant maid to deliver France?
The thing was absurd; and yet&ndash;&ndash;he dared not send her home
lest after all there might be truth in what she claimed. And
so the matter rested.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>The days dawned and waned, and still the men-at-arms were
not provided. Jeanne shed bitter tears over the delay. She
believed so implicitly in her Voices that she could not understand
why others did not have the same faith. And the fame
of her grew and spread, going out into the country even beyond
the valley.</p>
<p>One day, as she was on her way to mass, a young man-at-arms
pushed his way through the crowd which had gathered to see
her to have a word with the wonderful peasant maid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, ma mie,&#8221; he said banteringly, &#8220;what are you doing
here? Must the King be driven from his Kingdom, and we all
turn English?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I came hither to the King&#8217;s territory, messire, to speak
with Sire Robert that he may take me, or cause me to be taken
to the Dauphin; but he heeds neither me nor my words. Notwithstanding,
ere mid-Lent I must be before the Dauphin,
were I in going to wear my legs to my knees.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reply was given with such intent seriousness that the
young knight was impressed, and he spoke more gently:</p>
<p>&#8220;Know you not, maiden, that Louis, the little son of Charles,
hath just been betrothed to the infant daughter of the King of
Scotland? King James is to send Madame Margaret to
France with an army of six thousand men before Whitsunday,
which, as you know, is in May. What need, therefore, is there
for you, a young girl, to go to the Dauphin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go to the Dauphin, messire; for no one in the world,
no king or duke or daughter of the King of Scotland<a name='FNanchor_0006' id='FNanchor_0006'></a><a href='#Footnote_0006' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
restore the realm of France. In me alone is help, albeit for
my part, I would far rather be spinning by my poor mother&#8217;s
side, for this life is not to my liking. But I must go, and so
I will, for it is Messire&#8217;s command that I should go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Messire?&#8221; asked he.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is God,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>The young man was moved. He stretched out his hands
suddenly as though he believed in spite of himself, and laid
his hands between hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; said he. &#8220;I, Jean de Novelonpont, commonly
called Jean de Metz, pledge you my word, knightly fashion,
my hands in your hands in token of fealty, that God helping
me I will take you to the King.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will, messire?&#8221; cried Jeanne joyfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;On my word of honour I promise it. When will you set
forth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This hour is better than to-morrow; to-morrow is better
than after to-morrow,&#8221; she told him, her face illumined with
smiles. It was the first gleam of hope that had lightened the
weary days of waiting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will make preparations at once,&#8221; he said, moved by her
zeal and by her strong sense of the necessity of immediate operations.
Then as he started to leave her, he turned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you travel in that garb, pucelle?&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0007' id='FNanchor_0007'></a><a href='#Footnote_0007' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> he asked hesitatingly.</p>
<p>Jeanne smiled, divining the difficulties he foresaw were she
to retain her woman&#8217;s garb in travelling. She had already
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
given the matter thought, and perceived that if she were to live
among soldiers she must change the dress she wore. So she
answered promptly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I will willingly dress as a man. In truth, it would be more
seemly.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Metz nodded approval, and went his way. After this,
because joys like sorrows come not singly, one after another
began to believe in her. In a few days another man-at-arms
came to her. He was an older man than de Metz and a graver.
At his salutation Jeanne looked at him intently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I not seen you somewhere, messire?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; he answered lightly. &#8220;Methinks I should not
have forgotten it had we ever met. Yet stay!&#8221; bending a keen
glance upon her. &#8220;Are not you the little maid who dressed
my wounded arm at your father&#8217;s house in Domremy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be, messire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; he affirmed. &#8220;The wound healed quickly, for the
treatment was good. So you are that little maid? And now
you have come here with a mission? Tell me of it, pucelle.
Can you in very truth do as you say: raise the siege of Orl&eacute;ans,
and bring the King to his anointing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I, messire; but my Lord, the King of Heaven, will
do it through me. I am but his humble instrument.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me of it,&#8221; he said again. &#8220;I have talked with Jean de
Metz, but I would hear of it from you.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no need for reserve concerning her mission, so
Jeanne talked of it freely to him. Indeed she did so to
whomsoever wished to hear about it. And when she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
made an end of the telling Bertrand de Poulengy placed his
hands in hers as de Metz had done, and pledged her fealty,
knightly fashion.</p>
<p>But though the men-at-arms were willing to set forth at once
there was still delay; for, being in service with Sire Robert, they
could not leave without his consent. Jeanne became impatient,
knowing that Orl&eacute;ans could not hold out forever. She was
cast down, not through want of faith in her divine mission, but
because of the obstacles which unbelieving men like Baudricourt
were putting in her way.</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name, gentle Robert,&#8221; she cried one day, meeting
him at the foot of the hill where his castle stood, &#8220;you are too
slow about sending me. This day hath a great disaster happened
to the Dauphin. Send me quickly lest a worse befall
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A disaster hath befallen the Dauphin?&#8221; exclaimed Sire
Robert. &#8220;How could you know that a disaster hath befallen
him to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My Voices have told me,&#8221; she made answer. &#8220;A battle
hath been lost near Orl&eacute;ans. Sire Robert, I must be sent to
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will see, I will see,&#8221; he said, looking troubled. &#8220;If this
be true, as you have said, then shall you go to him. But is it
by evil or by good spirits that you speak?&#8221;</p>
<p>Without waiting for a reply he left her abruptly. As
Jeanne sat spinning with Catherine le Royer the next morning
she was greatly surprised when the door opened suddenly, and
the Governor himself, accompanied by Jean Fournier, the parish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
priest, entered. At a sign from Sire Robert, Catherine
quitted the room, and Jeanne was left with the two men. The
priest immediately put on his stole, and pronounced some Latin
words:</p>
<p>&#8220;If thou be evil, away with thee; if thou be good, draw
nigh.&#8221; With this he sprinkled holy water about the room,
and upon her.</p>
<p>Jeanne was hurt when she heard the words, for it was the
formula used for exorcism. It was believed that if the village
maiden were possessed of evil spirits they would be driven away.
Having recited the formula and sprinkled holy water the priest
expected, if the girl were possessed, to see her struggle and
writhe in the effort to take flight. But there was nothing suspicious
in Jeanne&#8217;s attitude. There was no wild agitation or
frenzy. She had fallen on her knees when the priest put on
his stole, and now anxiously, entreatingly, she dragged herself
to him. Messire Jean Fournier stretched forth his hand in
benediction over her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever be the spirit with which she is filled, it is naught
of evil,&#8221; he said to Robert de Baudricourt.</p>
<p>With this the two men left the cottage as abruptly as they
had entered it. Jeanne burst into tears, and so Catherine
found her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Messire Jean should not have used me so,&#8221; sobbed the
maiden as she related the happening to her hostess. &#8220;I have
confessed to him daily since I came to Vaucouleurs, and he
should have known what manner of girl I was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there, little one,&#8221; soothed Catherine, tenderly. &#8220;He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
but did it to please the Sire Captain. Perchance now that
the gentle Robert knows that evil spirits do not possess thee,
he will give thee aid.&#8221;</p>
<p>The exorcism did in truth help Jeanne&#8217;s cause with the
Governor. If the young girl were not possessed of evil it
followed naturally that the power in her must be good; therefore
he was at last willing to aid her. Secretly he had already
sent a messenger to the King telling of the maiden, her mission,
her saintly way of living, and asking that he might send her to
him. He but waited the consent of Charles before starting
Jeanne on her journey. This she did not learn until later.</p>
<p>Meantime she was restless. She longed to be about her
work, and there seemed naught but hindrances. She felt that
she must start, for she must be with the Dauphin by mid-Lent,
and the time was short. One day Lassois came to see how she
was, and also to bring news of her parents; for Jeanne had sent
them a letter praying for their forgiveness and blessing. As
she could neither read nor write the Cur&eacute; had written it for
her, and he had added details of the life she was living, her
good deeds, her saintly ways, and aught else that he thought
would set their minds at rest concerning her. Now she listened
eagerly as Durand told her how the letter had been received.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jacques has heard a great deal about you from the people,
Jeanne. Know you not that the whole countryside is talking
of you? He has known all along how you were living, and
what you were doing. He is still not reconciled to your leaving
home, but he said that so long as you lived a good life you
had his blessing and forgiveness. Isabeau wept when she
heard the letter, but she sends love, and prays you to make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
short work of the matter that you may soon be home again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would that I might, Uncle Durand,&#8221; groaned the girl.
&#8220;But there seems naught but hindrance and delay. I should
like to be at home with mother; if my work were done I could
be. The time is so short. I can not, I must not wait longer.&#8221;
She bowed her head and wept. Presently she dashed away the
tears and turned to Durand as though an idea had come to her:
&#8220;Uncle Durand,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;Will you take me into France?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to walk there, Jeanne?&#8221; he asked amazed. &#8220;&#8217;Tis
said to be all of a hundred and fifty leagues to where the
Dauphin bides at Chinon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even so, I must go. If Sire Robert will not give me men-at-arms
I must go without them. Will you go with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he assented readily. Had Jeanne not been so preoccupied
she would have seen the smile that lurked in his eyes.
Lassois was a hard-headed, practical man, and he knew that
the plan was not feasible. He hoped that his niece would see
it too, so he added: &#8220;I will get Alain to go with us. &#8217;Tis
a dangerous journey even with men-at-arms for escort. When
do we start?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At once,&#8221; cried the maiden eagerly. &#8220;The sooner the better.
When the siege is raised, and the Dauphin crowned, I
can go back home. And I will not leave them again. Go! get
Alain, and let us start.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lassois left her, and Jeanne made her preparations quickly.
Procuring a man&#8217;s jerkin, hose and doublet, she arrayed herself
in them, and when Lassois returned with Alain, a friend
of his who lived in Vaucouleurs, the three set forth. They had
proceeded a league on the road to France when they came to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
the shrine of Saint Nicholas, and this Jeanne entered as was
her wont, and prostrated herself in prayer. When she arose
the impatience, the restlessness were gone. She faced her
companions with contrition.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was wrong,&#8221; she said with deep humility. &#8220;It is not meet
that I go to the Dauphin in this manner. We must go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Durand&#8217;s countenance expanded into a broad grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Said I not so, Alain?&#8221; he cried, nudging his friend. &#8220;I
said that she would soon see that it was not fitting that she
should go thus. I said that soon we would turn back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alain laughed also as Jeanne gazed at her uncle in astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know, uncle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why see, ma mie; the King would not receive you should
you go to him thus humbly; but if you come from the Sire
Captain with proper escort &#8217;twill be easy to get his ear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; sighed Jeanne. &#8220;I was wrong. We will go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>She waited with more grace after this, and presently there
came a day when her patience was rewarded. The messenger
from the King rode into Vaucouleurs bearing a letter to the
Governor which gave consent to send the young prophetess to
him. Sire Robert sent at once for the maiden.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There was a disaster as you
said near Orl&eacute;ans. The Battle of Herrings was lost at Rouvray.
Colet de Vienne, the King&#8217;s messenger, tells me that
Charles will receive you. Therefore, get you ready, for now
you shall start for Chinon in a few days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overjoyed Jeanne hastened back to her friends to tell the
glad news. The impossible had happened. That which the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
peasant maid had demanded was granted. She was to be
taken to the King, and in the time fixed by herself.</p>
<p>The sweetness, the simplicity, the sturdy purpose of the
maiden had won all hearts in the little walled town. Knowledge
of her mission had deepened the interest felt in her, so
now, as she was in very truth to begin her journey, they took
upon themselves the expense of her outfit. A complete suit
of masculine apparel was bought, a jerkin, a cloth doublet,
hose laced to the coat, gaiters, spurs, a whole equipment of
war, while Sire Robert gave her a horse. And Jeanne, with
one girlish sigh at the sacrifice, took off her coif, let down her
long dark locks, and gave a last look at them; then Catherine
cut them round, page fashion, the maiden set on a cap, and
was ready.</p>
<p>Jean de Metz and Bertrand de Poulengy were to accompany
her, as well as the King&#8217;s messenger, Colet de Vienne, and the
bowman, Richard, with two lancers, servants of the men-at-arms.
These men proposed further waiting, as certain soldiers
of Lorraine were infesting the country, but the maiden was not
afraid, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name, take me to the gentle Dauphin, and fear not
any hindrance or trouble we may meet. There hath been too
much delay.&#8221;</p>
<p>At length, however, everything was in readiness, and on the
twenty-third of February, the little company assembled before
the gate, La Porte de France, with friends to watch the
departure. Among them were the kind Lassois, Catherine and
Henri le Royer, Jean Colin, canon of Saint Nicholas, to whom
Jeanne had confessed at times.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>The women trembled and wept as they looked at the girl, so
fair in her young loveliness, and feared for her the perils of
the journey. One of them cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you set forth on such a journey when there are
men-at-arms on every hand?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jeanne turned a happy face toward them, and answered
out of the serene peace of her heart:</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not fear men-at-arms. My way has been made plain
before me. If there be men-at-arms my Lord God will make
a way for me to go to my Lord Dauphin. For this I was
born.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sire Robert also was present, and as he gazed at the bright
face of the maiden his grim old heart was touched.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swear,&#8221; he said, making Jean de Metz kneel before him.
&#8220;Swear that you will deliver this maiden whom I have confided
to your care safely and surely to the King.&#8221;</p>
<p>And De Metz answered solemnly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I swear.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so from each and every man the Governor took the oath.
Then belting his own sword about the girl&#8217;s slender waist, he
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Go! and come of it what may.&#8221;</p>
<p>And off into the mists that enveloped the meadows of the
Meuse rode the little company down the road into France.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>And so began this strange ride; the strangest that was
ever made. There were a thousand perils to be
encountered: great rivers to be crossed; great forests
infested by wolves to be traversed; trackless spaces of a country,
half of which was hostile&ndash;&ndash;full of every danger of war, to
be covered.</p>
<p>Jeanne had been told many times of the risks of the journey;
but, happy in the knowledge that she was at last on her way
to the Dauphin, no peril, no danger seemed formidable. She
had no fear of marauding bands, nor did she feel anxiety concerning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
the conduct of her companions. A great peace filled
her soul. She had begun her work. How it was all to end
for her she neither foresaw nor asked; she only knew what she
had to do. So light hearted did she appear that Bertrand de
Poulengy wondered at it. Jeanne noticed him regarding her
curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, messire?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a hard, tiresome ride, Pucelle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, messire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To sit in the saddle long hours is most fatiguing. Have
you been accustomed to riding?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, messire. I never rode at all until I came to Vaucouleurs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not? I can hardly believe that, Pucelle.&#8221; He
gave a glance of frank admiration at the slight, erect figure
sitting her horse so martially. &#8220;You ride as though born to
the saddle, which is well, for the journey will tax your endurance
to the utmost. We stop to-night at the Abbey of
Saint Urbain for rest and refreshment, but to-morrow and
thereafter we shall be obliged to rest in the open fields. We
must avoid the frequented roads and the cities held by the English,
therefore we can not go to the inns. There will be many
dangers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you fear, messire?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That we shall never reach Chinon,&#8221; he answered gloomily.
&#8220;The hazards are too great. I thought that the Captain would
give us more of an escort, but we be but seven all told. Of
what avail would such a small number be against an attacking
force of freebooters?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Jeanne turned a smiling face toward him; a face as
blithe and bright as that of a fair youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have no fear,&#8221; she said, with calm confidence. &#8220;My
brothers in Paradise will watch over us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you really do what you say?&#8221; he questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do what I am commanded to do, messire. My
brethren in Paradise tell me what I have to do. It is now four
years since my brethren in Paradise and Messire told me that I
must go forth to war to deliver the realm of France.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Poulengy, De Metz, and their companions had not the
maiden&#8217;s confidence. Now that the irrevocable step was taken
and they were actually embarked upon this wild adventure the
chill of reflection was upon them. Was the girl really an inspired
prophetess, or a witch? If the former, all would be
well with them should they reach Chinon in safety; if the
latter, they were liable to come to the gallows for bringing a
witch to court. So many doubts and misgivings assailed them
as they rode forward.</p>
<p>Far into the night they rode, stopping at length at the Abbey
of Saint Urbain on the right bank of the Marne for rest.
From time immemorial the Abbey had been a place of refuge,
and it gave them a cordial welcome. Jeanne was glad to lay
her wearied body upon the rude cot in the house set apart for
the use of strangers, but she was up early next morning, and
attended conventual mass; then she and her companions took
horse again. Crossing the Marne by the bridge opposite Saint
Urbain they pressed on towards France.</p>
<p>They were in more dangerous ground now, so they proceeded
more stealthily. Bertrand de Poulengy and Jean de Metz,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
being hardened campaigners and accustomed to such expeditions,
knew the by-ways, and were acquainted with the means
necessary to travel quietly. Sometimes the days were sunlit,
and the nights moonlit; at other times, there was rain, or sleet,
or snow, but whatever the weather they rode and rode. Jeanne
was always cheerful, always confident, always good-humoured.
The King&#8217;s messenger, Colet de Vienne, Sire Bertrand and
Jean de Metz were hot-headed, hot-hearted soldiers of fortune,
neither over-scrupulous nor over-pious, but they learned to regard
the young girl in their charge with reverence and awe. It
was a feeling that strangely combined chivalry and religion.
She was so devout, so clean-spirited, that there was nothing to
be done but to believe in her goodness, her purity, and her faith.
If they did not altogether believe in her visions they believed
that she believed, and they came to think of her as nothing less
than a saint.</p>
<p>&#8220;Truly, Bertrand, she comes from God,&#8221; declared De Metz
one day upon his return from a town where he had gone in
search of food. The party dared not enter the place for fear
of detection. The news was broadcast over the country that the
inspired Maid of Vaucouleurs was proceeding to the King under
escort, and the knights feared an encounter with some band
of the enemy. &#8220;She has not much money; that I know, yet
she gave me alms to give to the poor. And this she does whenever
we draw near to a town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a saint,&#8221; avowed De Poulengy. &#8220;I think she must be
inspired in very truth, Jean; else how is it that she stands the
journey as she does? A little wearied she may be when we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
stop for rest, but do you note that she starts onward as blithely
and gayly as though we had but just set forth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay! I have noticed it. &#8217;Tis as though she received manna
from Heaven for her recuperation. Through many wild
marches I have been, yet this one hath been the most trying.
I fear ambuscades, Bertrand, and I would not have harm come
to the Maid. I would rather lose life itself than have aught
befall her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I, Jean. But I fear that all of our company do not
agree with us. I overheard some words that Richard the
Archer had with our two varlets this morning which shows
their mind in manner most alarming. They also have noted
the marvellous way in which the Maid has withstood the fatigues
of the journey, and they declare that a mere maiden could not
bear them as she does. In truth, they deem her a witch. We
must be on our guard against them lest they try some trick
against her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The vile caitiffs! Can they not see that she is one of
God&#8217;s saints?&#8221; exclaimed De Metz wrathfully. &#8220;I will go to
them. I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay, Jean; restrain yourself,&#8221; counselled the older man
laying his hand lightly on the other&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Be not too severe
in your judgment &#8217;gainst the varlets. Time was, and not so
long since, when we too were in doubt concerning the maiden.
They may intend no harm, but I deemed it the part of wisdom
to put you on guard. Let us say nothing, but watch and wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Bertrand.&#8221; De Metz spoke more quietly.
&#8220;They may intend no harm, but &#8217;tis well to be on guard. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
they should attempt anything&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He paused, touching his
sword significantly.</p>
<p>Poulengy nodded, and the two returned to the camp. As
they made night marches they rested by day. For this day
they had selected for camp a cove that lay between two shoulders
of the winding hills on the banks of a swollen stream.
Though a cold rain was falling there was no fire for fear of
the enemy. The leafless boughs did little to ward off the rain,
and there was not much comfort in the chill woods, so the party
ate in silence the cold bread and meat which De Metz had obtained
in the town. They but waited for the darkness that they
might take to horse again. Richard the bowman was sentinel,
and after the comfortless meal they all lay down on the wet
ground to get what rest they could. They were aroused by a
wild shout from the Archer, who rushed among them, crying:</p>
<p>&#8220;The English! The English are upon us!&#8221;</p>
<p>Instantly the two knights and the King&#8217;s messenger were
upon their feet, and drawing their swords, threw themselves
quickly before Jeanne. She alone was undisturbed, and
merely rose to a sitting posture as the men breathlessly awaited
the approach of the enemy. The knights&#8217; servants, Jean de
Honecourt and Julien, made as though about to flee when
Jeanne spoke in her grave, sweet voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not flee. I tell you in God&#8217;s name, they will not harm
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this Richard the bowman, seeing that she was not afraid,
burst out laughing. With a bound Jean de Metz had reached
him, and had him by the throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Varlet,&#8221; he cried, shaking the fellow angrily. &#8220;Know you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
not that there are perils enough about us without giving a false
alarm? That loud outcry of yours may bring the enemy upon
us. I am minded to fling you into that water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I but did it to scare the witch,&#8221; muttered Richard sullenly,
eyeing the swollen stream with whitening face. The water
was dismally cold, and very deep at this point. &#8220;I meant no
harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>But De Metz, enraged by the word &#8220;witch,&#8221; lifted him
bodily, preparatory to carrying out his threat, when Jeanne&#8217;s
soft tones arrested him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not so, my friend,&#8221; she said sweetly. &#8220;The jest was
ill timed, &#8217;tis true; but still it was but a jest. He could neither
frighten nor harm me. None can do that until I have fulfilled
my mission. Let him go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You hear?&#8221; De Metz let the man slide slowly to his feet.
&#8220;But that she pleads for thee thou shouldst drink deep of that
water. See to it that thy acts are better, else it shall go hard
with thee. Ay! or whoever attempts tricks, be they jest or
earnest.&#8221;</p>
<p>He glared at the retainers so fiercely that they shrank from
his gaze. There was no further attempt to frighten the maiden
during the rest of the journey, and it was noted that she had
no more devoted servitor than Richard the bowman.</p>
<p>On they rode, and still on. Through gloomy woods, by
threatened highways, and over swollen rivers the seven made
their way. The enemy&#8217;s country was passed in time without
mishap of any kind, and then on the morning of the tenth day
out from Vaucouleurs they came to Gien on the River Loire.
It held for the Dauphin, and Jeanne rejoiced for now, being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
in friendly territory, she could go to mass. She had felt neither
fear nor anxiety during the march, but she had been distressed
that she could not attend mass, which she was accustomed to
doing every day. Being on God&#8217;s errand she wished constantly
to ask His help.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we could, we should do well to hear mass,&#8221; she had repeated
wistfully each day; but when the knights told her that
it was too dangerous she had not insisted.</p>
<p>Gien was about forty miles above Orl&eacute;ans, and their danger
was now almost over. Both Jeanne and the knights talked
freely of her errand, and the news spread far and wide that a
Maid was come from the borders of Lorraine to raise the siege
of Orl&eacute;ans and lead the Dauphin to Reims to be crowned.
Everywhere the people were excited over the tidings. In spite
of the blockade men often slipped into Orl&eacute;ans, and messengers
from Gien soon bore the story into the besieged city. It raised
a great hope there, and its commander, the Count of Dunois, at
once sent two of his officers to Chinon, whither he knew that the
Maid was bound, to ask the King to send her to them soon.</p>
<p>The news that Jeanne learned concerning Orl&eacute;ans was most
disquieting. The Battle of Herrings, fought at Rouvray, had
been a most disastrous defeat for the garrison, and had brought
both citizens and soldiers to despair. No time should be lost in
going to the help of the leaguered city, so, after a short rest,
Jeanne rode forward across the sandy Sologne and the flat
country of Touraine.</p>
<p>The anxiety of Poulengy and Metz had taken a different
turn. Believe in the maiden as they might they could not but
wonder what reception they would meet at Court. Charles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
and his counsellors might think it all a fool&#8217;s errand, and the
knights would be the laughing stock of their comrades. As
they had become accustomed to doing they told these misgivings
to Jeanne.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not be afraid. You will see how graciously the fair
Dauphin will look upon us when we get to Chinon,&#8221; she assured
them confidently.</p>
<p>They were now in a country holding for the Dauphin, and
naturally it would be supposed that it was friendly territory;
this, however, was not the case. Indeed, it was after the passage
of the Loire that they were exposed to the greatest danger.
Far and wide the tidings had flown that a girl was coming toward
the King with wonderful proffers of aid from Heaven and
the Holy Saints. There were people about the King to whom
such news was not welcome. Here also in the King&#8217;s country
were freebooters who, when they pillaged travellers, asked not
whether they were Armagnacs or Burgundians, and such men
would not scruple to waylay the girl at a word from those about
the King. So it happened that certain men-at-arms of the
French party lay in ambush awaiting the appearance of
Jeanne&#8217;s little company to surprise them. It was the intention
to capture the maiden, cast her into a pit, and keep her there
under a great stone trap door, in the hope that the King who
had sent for her would give a large sum for her rescue. But
of all this neither Jeanne nor her escort knew until long afterward.</p>
<p>Being in the Dauphin&#8217;s territory Jeanne rode fearlessly in
front of the little company while the knights, who lacked her
confidence, followed close behind, keeping a keen watch the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
while, for they were passing through a deep wood, and both
Bertrand and De Metz were aware of the character of the miscreants
who infested it. Suddenly, from out of the inner
wood, there burst a party of men who with wild yells dashed
forward and surrounded them. There was a clash of steel as
the knights met the onset, when high above the noise of swords
sounded Jeanne&#8217;s voice, clear and bell-like:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold! Let not French blood be spilled by Frenchmen
while the English wait us at Orl&eacute;ans. Forbear, friends! &#8217;Tis
not God&#8217;s will that you should slay each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Involuntarily the men of both parties stayed their uplifted
hands. The leader of the attacking band bent a searching,
curious glance upon the maiden, which she met calmly and tranquilly.
There was something winning and persuasive and convincing
in her manner; something so pure and unearthly in her
look that presently the man&#8217;s eyes dropped, and he hastily
crossed himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pass on,&#8221; he said, and at a sign his fellows fell back, and
the seven rode on in safety.</p>
<p>Sire Bertrand leaned over to Jean de Metz and spoke in an
awed tone:</p>
<p>&#8220;Saw you that, Jean? Those rascals could do naught after
she cried out. Truly the child is sent from God.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is in very truth, Bertrand, but it needed not this to
prove it. Witness how we have come these many leagues
though threatened with dire perils without hap of any kind.
&#8217;Tis nothing short of miraculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jeanne heard them wondering, and smiled at them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Marvel not,&#8221; she said. &#8220;God clears the way for me. I
was born for this.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so they came to the green slopes of Fierbois, from which
place they would proceed to Chinon, where the King lay.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>The King lay at Chinon, just six leagues from Fierbois,
and Jeanne decided to write to him, asking permission
to come to the town, for neither of the knights dared go
further without his consent. Accordingly Sire Bertrand procured
a scribe, and the maiden dictated the following letter:</p>
<div style="font-size:95%; margin:3% 5%">
<p>&#8220;Gentle Dauphin,&ndash;&ndash;I have ridden a hundred and fifty
leagues to bring you aid from Messire, the King of Heaven.
I have much good news for you, and would beg that out of your
grace you will allow me to tell it to you in person. Though I
have never seen you, yet I should know you in any disguise
among a thousand. May God give you long life.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Jeanne the Maid.</span>&#8221;<span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>Colet de Vienne, the King&#8217;s messenger, took the missive, and
at once set forth at speed for Chinon. A day at least must pass
before the answer could come back, so Jeanne availed herself of
the privilege of hearing mass in the village church dedicated to
Saint Catherine, one of her daily visitors.</p>
<p>It was the most famous sanctuary of the Saint, for here she
received multitudes of pilgrims and worked great miracles.
Her worship was warlike and national, and dated back to the
beginning of French history. Jeanne lingered lovingly in the
chapel, hearing three masses, and listening with delight to the
stories of the miracles.</p>
<p>The next day, having received permission to proceed to
Chinon, they mounted and faced toward the town, and the
maiden&#8217;s heart beat fast. She was going to the King at last.
That which she had dreamed for four years was being realized.
She was going to the King, and her heart sang for joy.</p>
<p>The nearer the company drew to Chinon they saw with
amazement that the country became poorer, for the Court and
the men-at-arms had stripped it bare. For this reason the
Dauphin could seldom abide long at one place, for he was so
much better known than trusted that the very cord-wainer
would not let him march off in a new pair of boots without
seeing his money. There was a song which said that he even
greased his old clouted shoon to make them last as long as he
might. There were many stories told about his extravagance
and consequent poverty. It was a poor prince to whom Jeanne
was going.</p>
<p>It had been a long journey, as De Poulengy had said it
would be, so that it was the eleventh day after leaving Vaucouleurs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
that they entered Chinon. It was March sixth, the
fourth Sunday in Lent, and therefore Laetare Sunday. In
far off Domremy the boys and the girls, the youths and the
maidens would be going to the Fairy Tree and the Gooseberry
Spring for the &#8220;Well Dressing.&#8221; They would eat their hard
boiled eggs with the rolls their mothers had kneaded. Pierre
would go and possibly Jean, though he was older than she.
The country would be grey and leafless there; here there were
already monitions of Spring. So Jeanne mused, but she did
not let her thoughts wander long to her far off home and
friends, for she was at last in Chinon, where the Dauphin
abode.</p>
<p>The town was built upon a meadow beside the river Vienne,
and was compactly walled. Behind it rose a high perpendicular
ledge on which the castle stood, the finest in the realm
of France. Behind its proud walls there breathed that King
to whom she had been impelled to come by a miraculous love.
Jeanne looked up at it with longing glance, but she must wait
until permission was accorded before ascending the steeps
which led to it, so, with a sigh, she turned her attention to the
town.</p>
<p>Through narrow lanes of overhanging houses crowded to the
hill beneath the castle buttresses they went, stopping at length
at an inn near the castle kept by a woman of good repute. It
was Lent, so the spits were idle, for at that time no one in
Christendom neglected the church&#8217;s injunction concerning the
fasts and abstinences of Holy Lent. So fasting Jeanne retired
to the chamber assigned her, and spent the next two days
in prayer while she waited to hear from the Dauphin.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>Then the messenger, Colet de Vienne, came with the command
that the two knights should come to the castle so that
they might be questioned concerning the maiden. He said
that the King had read the letter of Sire Robert, but would
know more before admitting her to audience. Sire Bertrand
heard the command with anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Colet, is this in truth the King&#8217;s desire, or hath he been influenced
to it by George la Tr&eacute;mouille? There be those who
say that the Favorite cares for naught that is for the good of
France, but is all for terms with Burgundy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not for me to say that Charles is not master of his
Court, Sire Bertrand,&#8221; replied the messenger warily. &#8220;Still,
it might be admitted that La Tr&eacute;mouille does not care to have
an inspired Maid appear who will arouse the King from his
indolence. And the King hath other advisers of the Royal
Council also who wish to know more of the damsel before she
approaches him. &#8217;Tis on their advice that he has sent for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he hath the letter vouching for her from the Captain
of Vaucouleurs,&#8221; exclaimed De Poulengy, with heat. &#8220;There
will be delay, and yonder lies Orl&eacute;ans waiting the coming of
the Maid; for by my faith! I do believe that she can raise the
siege. Ay! and Jean here believes likewise. &#8217;Tis our opinion
that she hath been divinely commissioned so to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why fret about telling the King what ye believe?&#8221;
asked Colet. &#8220;He questioned me, and I spoke freely concerning
her goodness, and the safety with which we had made the
journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; uttered De Poulengy. &#8220;Why fret indeed?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
&#8217;Tis only because it seems to me that were I King I would seize
upon anything that held a hope for so distressed a kingdom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis what frets us all, Bertrand,&#8221; said Jean de Metz.
&#8220;That is, all who care for the King and France. Know you
not that La Hire, the fiercest soldier of the Armagnacs, says,
&#8216;Never was a king who lost his kingdom so gay as Charles?&#8217;
But lead on, Colet. &#8217;Tis the King&#8217;s command, and we must go
to him. Perchance good may come from it after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That it may. And know for your comfort, both, that deputies
from Orl&eacute;ans, having heard of the Maid, are here in Chinon
praying that the King may not refuse the aid, but will send the
Maid to them at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that is good,&#8221; ejaculated Sire Bertrand. &#8220;I can go
with better grace now. Come, Jean.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seldom has a king lived who deserved greater contempt than
Charles Seventh. Lazy, idle, luxurious, and cowardly, he
was the puppet of his worst courtiers. Most of the money that
he could raise was spent in voluptuous living or given to favorites.
But at that time however contemptible a king might
be, his personality was important to his kingdom. So that
Charles Seventh was France to his people; the image and
sacred symbol of France.</p>
<p>In his favor it may be said that he was very devout, and his
piety was sincere. He was generous to others,&ndash;&ndash;and to himself.
He was &#8220;well languaged and full of pity for the poor.&#8221;
From time to time he would seem to be moved by the thought
that, despite his helplessness and inability to do anything, he
was still the man who ought to do all. But he was weak, a
slave to his favorites, blind to their defects; ready to suffer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
anything from them. It was small wonder then that De
Poulengy dreaded the King&#8217;s advisers. He and De Metz
returned soon to the inn to report to Jeanne the result of the
interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis pity that the King is not the only person who governs
the realm,&#8221; spoke Sire Bertrand with disgusted weariness.
&#8220;But no! the whole Royal Council must give consent ere he
can admit you to an audience, Pucelle. There are certain of
the counsellors who advise against seeing you, declaring that
your mission is a hoax. Some say that you are a witch, and for
Charles to receive a witch into his presence would endanger his
person, and greatly discredit his majesty. There are still others
who favor seeing you; and Yolande, Queen of Sicily and
the king&#8217;s mother-in-law, declares openly that since Sire Robert
sent letters introducing you, which you carried through many
leagues of hostile provinces, fording many rivers in manner
most marvellous so that you might come to him, the King ought
at least to hear you. By my faith, Yolande is the best adviser
and the best soldier that the King has. So there the matter
rests; but he ought to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which he will, messire. Have no doubt of that. He will
hear and see me soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; in time, Pucelle. But ere that time comes certain
priests and clerks, experts in discerning good spirits from bad,
are to examine you. They follow us, do they not, Jean?&#8221;</p>
<p>De Metz nodded. &#8220;If I mistake not they come now,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name, why do they not set me about my work?&#8221;
exclaimed Jeanne impatiently.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></div>
<p>Almost immediately steps were heard without the chamber,
and the hostess of the inn entered, bowing low before several
imposing ecclesiastics and their clerks.</p>
<p>Jeanne rose, and courtesied; standing in reverent attitude
during the entire interview. The visitors showed their astonishment
plainly in finding that the renowned Maid of Vaucouleurs
was such a mere girl. The senior bishop acted as spokesman
for all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you the maid concerning whom letters have come to
the King from Vaucouleurs?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne bowed her head in assent.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you in truth made that long perilous journey to speak
with the King?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, messire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem o&#8217;er young for such a fatiguing march. You
are, I should judge, not over sixteen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seventeen, messire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you, as &#8217;tis said, a message for the King?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, messire,&#8221; returned the maiden briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell it to us. We in turn will bear it to the King.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne drew herself up at this, and stood regarding them
calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot, messire,&#8221; she said at length. &#8220;It is for the gentle
Dauphin alone to hear. To him, and to none other, will I
tell it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maiden,&#8221; said the senior bishop earnestly, &#8220;the King hath
many counsellors who are wise and learned men. It is their
opinion that he ought not to see you until he learns the nature
of your mission. If you in truth have aught that is good for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
him to hear, it were best to tell it us. That is, if you desire admission
to his presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is not the Dauphin master of his presence? Is it not his to
say who shall, or who shall not be admitted to him?&#8221; demanded
the maiden in such open eyed wonder that the prelate looked
confused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; he said hastily. &#8220;But he sends certain of his
friends to see if those who seek admission are worthy to enter
his presence. Be advised, my child, and tell us why you wish
to see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a long moment Jeanne stood looking at him as though
she saw him not; then suddenly her face became transfigured
with joy, for the Light shone beside her, and she bowed her
head. The Voice that she waited for came instantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell of thy mission, Daughter of God,&#8221; it said. &#8220;But of
that which concerns the Dauphin speak not. Rise, and answer
boldly. We will aid thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>The maiden raised her head, and said gently:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have leave from &#8216;My Voices,&#8217; messire, to tell you that I
have two commands laid upon me by the King of Heaven.
One, to raise the siege of Orl&eacute;ans; the other, to lead the Dauphin
to Reims that he may be crowned and anointed there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bishops heard her with amazement. They had not seen
the Light, nor heard the Voice, but they saw that the maiden
had received a communication of some kind, either from inward
communion, or some celestial visitor. The senior bishop&#8217;s
tones showed his wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are marvellous commands, my child. What sign can
you give us that you can perform them?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I have not come to give signs,&#8221; cried Jeanne, her impatience
flaring forth at this. &#8220;Give me men-at-arms, and let
me show the work I am appointed to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then will you relate how the commands were given to
you?&#8221; questioned the bishop.</p>
<p>Briefly, because Jeanne never liked to talk much of her
visions, the maiden told something concerning the matter. The
whole of it she did not tell. Then followed questions pertaining
to her manner of life, her devotion, her habits about taking
the sacraments of communion and confession, and so on. To
all of these she made answer freely, with such modest mien that
the ecclesiastics finally withdrew, charmed by her simplicity and
earnestness.</p>
<p>And now the delay was ended; for, as evening fell, there came
the Count de Vend&ocirc;me, a gracious nobleman richly attired, to
escort her to the King. De Poulengy and De Metz rejoiced
that there would be no further delay. Being personal attendants
of Jeanne&#8217;s they were to accompany her to the castle.
Count de Vend&ocirc;me eyed the simple page attire of the maiden
soberly. She was clad like the varlet of some lord of no great
estate, in black cap with a little silver brooch, a grey doublet,
and black and grey hose, trussed up with many points; the
sword that Robert de Baudricourt had given her hung by her
side. At first sight she might well have passed for a boy, she
was so slender and carried herself so erectly. There was admiration
in the nobleman&#8217;s glance as he surveyed her gracious
figure, but his words were grave:</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you attend the audience in that garb, Pucelle?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>And Jeanne, remembering how De Metz with a like expression
of countenance had asked a similar question when she
wore her woman&#8217;s dress, laughed cheerily.</p>
<p>&#8220;This and none other, messire. For in this garb shall I do
that which is commanded.&#8221;</p>
<p>So led by the nobleman and followed by the two knights the
maiden started for the castle. Up a broad winding path they
wended their way to the rocky ridge of hill along which the
great walls of the castle, interrupted and strengthened by huge
towers, stretched. It was old and great and strong, having
been builded when the Romans were lords of the land, and was
a favorite seat of English kings before it passed into the hands
of the French. From the high drawbridge above the moat,
which was twenty feet deep, there was a wide prospect over the
town and the valley of the Vienne. Soldiers idled and diced
just within the gate, though the dice were scarce discernible
in the fast falling darkness. They ceased the play as Jeanne
and her attendants came upon the drawbridge, and a murmur
ran from lip to lip, for by this time all in Chinon knew of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;La Pucelle! La Pucelle! The inspired Maid from Vaucouleurs
comes to see the King.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this soldiers and sentinels turned to gaze curiously at the
girl. Suddenly one started from among his fellows, and came
very close to her, peering impudently into her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;By all the saints, &#8217;tis a pretty wench!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;May
God send more such witches to Chinon. I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But angrily Jean de Metz swept him out of the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jarnedieu!&#8221; cried the soldier wrathfully, using the common
oath of his class.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dost thou jarnedieu?&#8221; cried Jeanne mournfully.
&#8220;Thou who art so near death?&#8221;</p>
<p>Like one turned to stone the man stood, and then, as some
of his comrades began to gibe at him, he came to himself and
turned upon them in a rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think you that I heed what a mad woman says?&#8221; he shouted.
&#8220;Nay; I defy her and her prophecies.&#8221; With this he uttered a
loud laugh, and leaned back heavily against the low wooden
pales of the bridge&#8217;s side, which were crazy and old. There
was a crash; and down and down he whirled. The deep waters
of the moat closed over him.</p>
<p>The soldiers looked grave and affrighted, and turned awed
looks upon the maiden and her companions, who were just
ascending the broad steps which gave entrance to the great hall
of the King&#8217;s ch&acirc;teau, where the audience was to be held.
Jeanne, being ahead with the Count de Vend&ocirc;me, had not seen
what had occurred, but she turned as the crash of the wooden
pales sounded.</p>
<p>&#8220;What hath happened?&#8221; she questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naught,&#8221; cried De Metz hastily, fearing that should he tell
her it would disturb her calm, and he was timorous concerning
the ordeal before the Maid. &#8220;The King should keep his bridge
in better repair, for but now some of its wooden palings snapped
in two.&#8221;</p>
<p>So without knowing that her prophecy had been fulfilled so
soon the maiden passed on into the great hall. The audience
chamber was crowded with curious courtiers and the royal
guard, and the place shone with the lustre of fifty flambeaux.
At the end of the vaulted room was a chimney of white stone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
in which a noble fire blazed, reflected by the polished oak boards
of the floor.</p>
<p>Veteran soldiers of the wars were there; counsellors, like the
favorite La Tr&eacute;mouille, prelates, like the Archbishop of Reims,
and trains of fair ladies with fine raiment and gay manners; all
gathered to see the sorceress. A throng of men and women in
velvet and cloth of gold, in crimson and azure such as she had
never seen. A brilliant mob of vivid colors; a company of the
noblest lords and ladies of France, their finery glowing in the
flaring flames of many torches. The fans of the ladies fluttered;
their high head-dresses, or hennins, towered above the
head coverings of the men; a thousand unfamiliar hues and
forms combined to dazzle the eyes and disturb the composure of
a peasant girl.</p>
<p>But Jeanne was neither disturbed nor dazzled. Eagerly
she looked to see the King. She did not care for the courtiers
gazing so intently at her&ndash;&ndash;some with amusement, some smiling,
some sneering, the most of them sceptical, but all of them gazing
at her with open curiosity; with surprise at her page&#8217;s attire,
her man-at-arms shoes, and above all at her hair which, cut
round like a page&#8217;s, flowed softly about her face. At this time
no woman, of whatever rank, showed the hair. It was worn
covered always in obedience to Saint Paul&#8217;s command. Jeanne
saw the amusement, and wonder, and scepticism on the faces
around her; saw but heeded them not; moving forward the
while with her eyes fixed ever on the figure seated on the
throne. Suddenly she stopped short with a stifled exclamation.
The Count de Vend&ocirc;me touched her arm gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kneel,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;The King is before you.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>But Jeanne did not respond. She looked at him who was
seated upon the throne, but made no obeisance. Instead she
knitted her brows in thoughtful manner, then turned deliberately
round and glanced searchingly about among the courtiers.
A low murmur of astonishment ran through the room as all at
once she moved quickly toward a group of courtiers, and pushing
them aside knelt before a soberly clad young man hiding
behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;God give you good life, gentle Dauphin,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is not I that am the King,&#8221; said he with smiling lips.
&#8220;Yonder he sits upon the throne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name, gentle Dauphin, say not so,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It
is you and no other.&#8221; Then rising from her knees she continued:
&#8220;Fair Dauphin, I am Jeanne the Maid. I am sent
to you by the King of Heaven to tell you that you shall be
anointed and crowned at Reims, and shall be lieutenant of
the King of Heaven, who is King of France.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles&#8217;s face grew grave as he heard the words. The little
masquerade planned for the amusement of the courtiers had
failed; the jest was over. Solemnly he spoke:</p>
<p>&#8220;How know you this, Maid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My Voices have told me. I have come to lead you to your
anointing, but first I must raise the siege of Orl&eacute;ans. This,
fair Dauphin, I can do if you will but give me men-at-arms.
Out of your grace, I beg you to send me at once to Orl&eacute;ans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Touched by her perfect sincerity, her intense earnestness, her
good faith, the King gazed musingly at her, and then asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;How shall I know that you can do this, Maid? What sign
can you give?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></div>
<p>&#8220;My sign shall be the raising of the siege of Orl&eacute;ans; but,
gentle Dauphin, I have another sign which is to be told to you
alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then tell it to me,&#8221; he said, drawing her into a window recess
out of ear shot of the courtiers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentle Dauphin, when you prayed this morning in your
oratory there was a great pain in your heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True;&#8221; nodded Charles.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you made a prayer there. Fair Dauphin, did you tell
to any one the prayer that you made?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered gravely. &#8220;I did not. &#8217;Tis a prayer that
concerns none but myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then quickly, earnestly, passionately, Jeanne spoke, addressing
him familiarly as an inspired prophetess:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you not pray that if you were the true heir of France,
and that if justly the kingdom were yours, that God might be
pleased to guard and defend you? But that if you were not
descended from the royal House of France God would grant
you escape from imprisonment or death by permitting you to
go into the land of Scotland or Spain, that you might find
refuge there?&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles&#8217;s face grew blank with amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did pray that, exactly,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;In my heart alone,
without pronouncing the words. Speak on, Maiden. Is there
aught from your heavenly visitors that would answer that
prayer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is, gentle Dauphin. Know then, to ease thy heart,
that I tell thee from Messire, that thou art the true heir of
France, and son of the King.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></div>
<p>She made the strange statement so authoritatively, so impressively
that the monarch&#8217;s countenance grew radiant.
Those watching the pair wondered at the change, but none knew
until long afterward what it was that the maiden had told
him. Now he took Jeanne&#8217;s hand and bowed over it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe in you, Maid,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Though all should doubt
yet do I believe. You shall have your men-at-arms, and go
to Orl&eacute;ans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now God be praised,&#8221; exclaimed the maiden joyfully.
&#8220;May he send you long life, oh fair and gentle Dauphin.
Give me the men soon, I pray you, that I may be about my
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall have your wish,&#8221; he said gently; and with this he
led her back to the gaping courtiers.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>The next day, as Jeanne sat with the two knights discussing
the audience of the evening before, here came
the Sire de Gaucourt, former commander of Orl&eacute;ans.
&#8220;Pucelle,&#8221; he said, bowing low before the Maid, &#8220;I come
to you by order of the King, whose desire it is that you should
leave this mean place and come to dwell in the Tower of
Coudray, which is more proper lodging for you, and nearer to
him. The friends who are with you shall accompany you, if
such be your desire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is in truth my desire,&#8221; spoke the maiden quickly with
an affectionate glance at Poulengy and Metz. &#8220;True and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
faithful friends have they proven themselves. Without their
aid I could not have come to the King. They believed in me
even before Sire Robert did. And they shall go with me to
Orl&eacute;ans, if they wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We do wish,&#8221; came from the knights simultaneously. &#8220;To
Orl&eacute;ans, or to any place that promises fighting for France.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would that we were now bound for Orl&eacute;ans,&#8221; sighed
Jeanne as the four set forth for the castle.</p>
<p>Up the steep approach to the castle they wended their way
once more. And now, being daylight, it was seen that the
long mass of embattled walls, of keeps, towers, turrets, curtains,
ramparts, and watch-towers were three castles separated one
from the other by dyke, barrier, postern, and portcullis. Arriving
on the ridge of hill Sire de Gaucourt led them past the
long line of machicolated battlements of the Middle Ch&acirc;teau
where the King dwelt, and across the bridge of the inner moat.
A curtain of stone connected a high tower on the moat bank
with another battlemented tower built into the buttressed cliff
wall. There was an archway in the curtain at the end of the
bridge, through which they passed to the Tower of Coudray.</p>
<p>Ascending a stairway they paused at its top, for here the
lieutenant of the tower, Guillaume Bellier, the King&#8217;s Major
Domo, waited to greet them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are to lodge with my own family, Pucelle,&#8221; he said,
making Jeanne a deep obeisance. &#8220;My wife comes now to
bear you to your chamber for rest and refreshment.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke a pleasant faced woman came forward from an
adjoining room, and greeted the maiden warmly. She showed
plainly her surprise at Jeanne&#8217;s attire, but seemed charmed by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
her youth and beauty. Sire Bertrand gave a sigh of satisfaction
as he saw the maiden depart in the lady&#8217;s company, and
remarked to De Metz in a low tone:</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad am I to see the Maid in such good hands as those of
Madame Bellier. She is a devout woman, and the two will take
much pleasure in each other&#8217;s company. It hath gone to my
heart to see such a mere girl without any of her own sex near
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but she hath angel visitors to bring her comfort and
solace, Bertrand, the like of which no other maid had ever
before. I believe her in very truth to be a messenger from the
blessed Saints that love France. Still, with you, I am glad
that Madame Bellier hath her in her care.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne&#8217;s chambers were in the upper story of the tower, and
Lieutenant Bellier sent her for a servant one of his own pages,
Louis de Coutes, sometimes called Mugot, who came from an
old warrior family which had been in service of the house of
Orl&eacute;ans for a century. Her two knights with their servants
had chambers just beneath hers.</p>
<p>And now that the King had taken her under his charge
people flocked to see her. Churchmen came to test her orthodoxy;
Captains to ask her about her knowledge of war; and all
the lords and ladies to question her concerning her mission, for
it was dull at Chinon, and a witch was worth looking at any day.
Jeanne was impatient to be about her work, but she answered
them all so aptly, and was so gentle and simple, that all who
met her grew to believe in her.</p>
<p>Many too were curious concerning the oak wood, asking if
the Bois Chesnu were not in her country, for every one now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
recalled Merlin&#8217;s prophecy, and was impressed by it. Every
day the King had her brought to him. He was weak and
timorous, but her simple faith impressed him, as it impressed
all who saw her, and her entire trust in him gave him some
courage and self-reliance. He wished to give the Maid men-at-arms
at once, as he had promised, but the Royal Council
over-ruled him. The Counsellors acknowledged that it was
not unusual for princes to have the counsel of devout women;
that women in whom was the voice of God were not to be
scorned; that even the kings of England were no less ready
than the kings of France to heed the words of saintly men and
women; still, it behooved him to proceed carefully in the matter,
lest he should be charged with helping himself by witchcraft.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages it was the custom for saints to speak with
kings and for kings to listen to them, but sorcery was the unpardonable
sin. Therefore, it was the opinion of the Royal Council
that, before giving the maiden the men-at-arms for which she
asked, she should be subjected to a more searching examination
than any that had yet been made. And while the talk waged
pro and con the fame of Jeanne grew and filled all mouths. She
fired the zeal of the captains who came to see her, and shamed
them into some hope of saving France; she charmed the ladies of
the Court by her modesty; while the common people told wonderful
stories of her piety, exploits and adventures. To bring
this about in the short time that she had been in Chinon was no
mean achievement for a girl of seventeen, but Jeanne, believing
God to be the author of the whole work, wondered only that
any one should hesitate for a moment to trust His messenger.</p>
<p>One day she attended mass in the royal chapel, as was her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
daily custom, and when her devotions were finished she rose to
find the King and a young nobleman standing beside her.
Jeanne courtesied to the monarch, whereupon he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;We have brought our cousin, the Duke of Alen&ccedil;on, to see
you, Jeanne. He hath great interest in the house of Orl&eacute;ans,
having married the daughter of Duke Charles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is welcome,&#8221; spoke Jeanne simply. &#8220;The more of the
blood royal there are here the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So we believe,&#8221; said the King, smiling. &#8220;It is our pleasure
that you dine with us to-day, that our cousin may learn more of
your mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Jeanne bowed low, charming Alen&ccedil;on by her courtly
manners. Then she and the Duke followed the King to the
dining hall. La Tr&eacute;mouille, the King&#8217;s favorite, was present
also. Barrel-like in appearance, a toper, and a usurer, loaning
money to the King and the nobles at high interest, La Tr&eacute;mouille
was a most important personage at Court. Dismissing
the rest of the courtiers the King sat down at the table with the
other three, the peasant maid not at all disturbed by being the
guest of royalty. Yet but one short month agone she had
been the guest of the humble Catherine le Royer, the wheelwright&#8217;s
wife.</p>
<p>But Jeanne did not think of this. Her thoughts were for
the Dauphin, and she was filled with the desire that he should
govern wisely and well the realm which he held in trust from
God. So she talked seriously to him, asking him to amend his
life, and live after God&#8217;s will. He was to be clement, and to
be a good lord to rich and poor, friend and enemy. If he
would be all this the King of Heaven would do for him what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
he had done for his ancestors, and would restore him to his
former estate.</p>
<p>And gazing into the bright, eager young face, flushed with
courage and glowing with celestial ardor the King was thrilled,
and longed to do kingly deeds and to be worthy of the blood of
Louis, his saintly ancestor. After the dinner the four went to
the meadows by the river, where Jeanne guided her horse and
wielded her lance with so much skill that both the King and
the Duke marvelled.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis but an indifferent steed you ride, Pucelle,&#8221; spoke
Alen&ccedil;on, for Jeanne was still using the horse that De Baudricourt
had bought for her. &#8220;I will send you another that shall
bear you more worthily.&#8221;</p>
<p>The very next day he presented her with a magnificent black
charger which Jeanne rode thereafter. It was the beginning
of a warm friendship between the two. He became one of the
maiden&#8217;s most enthusiastic supporters, and Jeanne grew fond
of him not only because he was son-in-law to the Duke of
Orl&eacute;ans, but because the English had done him wrong, and he
had a good will to fight. Jeanne measured men by that standard.
She had a wholesome, hearty contempt for men who
skulked at Court and spent their time in idle pleasure while
France lay under the heel of the invader. Alen&ccedil;on had but
just returned to his home after being held captive by the
English for three years. It was told of him that his captors
had proposed to give him back his liberty and his goods if he
would join their party, but he rejected the offer. He was
young like her, and Jeanne thought that like her he must be
sincere and noble.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></div>
<p>In spite of her increasing influence over churchmen, and
captains, and people, the King still wavered, influenced by the
Royal Council and the favorite. La Tr&eacute;mouille, though indifferent
to Jeanne, because he had not yet come to dread her
power and to intrigue against her as he did a few months
later, was disinclined to action, and had no intention of allowing
Charles to shake off his indolence. So there were further
delays while the King&#8217;s confessor and others examined the
maiden daily. Though she was aware that these men questioned
her by orders from the King, Jeanne did not talk freely,
but answered discreetly concerning her mission.</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name, my fair duke, why do they ask so many
questions instead of setting me about my work?&#8221; she asked
piteously of Alen&ccedil;on one day after a visit from some of the
bishops.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perchance &#8217;tis natural for them to doubt,&#8221; replied the duke
consolingly. &#8220;You will have to be patient, Jeanne, though
there is much to try you in delay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Patient, patient!&#8221; ejaculated Jeanne, who was eating her
heart out with the desire to engage the enemy immediately at
Orl&eacute;ans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can Orl&eacute;ans hold out forever? Why do they not take
Messire&#8217;s word as it comes to them? Daily do I pray to be
delivered from these churchmen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alen&ccedil;on laughed, but checked his mirth quickly at sight of
the tears that were in Jeanne&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Endure a little longer, my friend,&#8221; he said gently. &#8220;I believe
that the end of these many queries is in sight, though
before it comes it has been decided to send you to Poictiers.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></div>
<p>&#8220;To Poictiers?&#8221; exclaimed Jeanne. &#8220;And why to Poictiers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Royal Council think it best for you to be examined
by the learned Doctors there,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;They acknowledge
that they can find no fault in you, but before giving you
men-at-arms to go to Orl&eacute;ans they wish that the Church should
pass upon your inspiration. When that is over I believe that
there will be no further delay in sending you to Orl&eacute;ans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the use in having learned men ask me questions
when I know neither A nor B?&#8221; queried Jeanne, dashing
the tears from her eyes. &#8220;But in God&#8217;s name, let us be going,
since we must go. Much ado will be there, I know. But
my Lord will help me. Now let us go, my bonny duke, in
God&#8217;s strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>The very next day she set forth for Poictiers, attended by a
large company, for many were eager to see how the peasant
maid would acquit herself before the learned Doctors. Beside
Alen&ccedil;on and her own knights there were certain veteran
men-at-arms among the company; men who laughed at the
idea that a mere girl of seventeen could raise the siege of
Orl&eacute;ans. There were many courtiers, some who believed in the
maid, and others who welcomed the diversion. The Queen&#8217;s
mother, Yolande, who wished to see her daughter seated firmly
upon the throne of France, and who believed in the simple shepherd
maid, went also. But her presence did not console
Jeanne, who fretted because so much valuable time was being
wasted.</p>
<p>There were learned doctors at Poictiers, which was distant
some fifty miles from Chinon. Men who, loyal to the King,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
had left the University of Paris as soon as the capital had
fallen into the hands of the English, and followed the fortunes
of Charles, choosing this town for their abiding place, and later
founding a university there. It was the home of the Bar also,
the great legal center, and here, if anywhere in Charles&#8217;s dominions,
it seemed probable that men might be found able to
distinguish between good spirits and bad.</p>
<p>On her arrival in the city Jeanne was lodged in the house of
<ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''Maitre'' in original text">Ma&icirc;tre</ins> Jean Robateau, the attorney general, a man of wealth
and distinction, married to an excellent wife. The house was
near the law courts, and had built into it a little chapel where
Jeanne went at once to pray. It proved a haven of refuge in
the days that followed.</p>
<p>The Archbishop of Reims presided over the Council which
was soon held. The Council appointed a Committee of Investigation,
and sent emissaries to Domremy to inquire into her
previous history. The Committee included several professors
of theology, an abbot, a canon of Poictiers, and one or two
friars. Escorted by a squire this Committee went to interview
Jeanne at Robateau&#8217;s house, for she was not formally examined
before the whole board of Doctors. She came to meet them
as they entered, but the sight of the priests irritated her. She
had been subjected to so much questioning at Chinon that she
was weary of it. It seemed so needless and futile. For working
priests and for people in religion she held a sacred regard.
For learned Doctors she had no use.</p>
<p>The squire, a young man of the sword named Thibault,
pleased her better than the priests, for he was in military dress.
She acknowledged the presence of the Committee with an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
obeisance, then went quickly to the squire and clapped him on
the shoulder, comrade fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would that I had many men of your way of thinking,
friend,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maid,&#8221; spoke the abbot gravely, &#8220;attend now to what we
shall say. We are sent to you from the King.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know quite well that you are sent to question me,&#8221; spoke
the maiden with spirit, &#8220;but of what avail is it? I know neither
A nor B.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this the Committee began to ply her with questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why have you come to Court?&#8221; asked the abbot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am come from the King of Heaven to raise the siege of
Orl&eacute;ans, and to lead the Dauphin to Reims for his crowning
and anointing,&#8221; she made answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what made you think of coming?&#8221; asked a professor of
theology.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of the great pity there was in Heaven for the
realm of France, my Voices told me to come, nothing doubting,&#8221;
replied the maiden earnestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your voices? What voices?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne saw that much as she disliked to talk of her visions,&ndash;&ndash;it
was always of her mission and her Voices that she told,&ndash;&ndash;there
was need of some explanation. The grave Doctors listened
attentively while she told something of her revelations, but not
all. She was a peasant maid, ignorant, simple, her hands
hardened with toil, her way of life humble and obscure, yet as
she related her ineffable experiences she seemed a thing divine.</p>
<p>Having much food for thought they questioned her no more
that day, and Jeanne retired to the chapel to seek comfort from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
her saints, who all this time continued to visit her daily, yet
giving only the one constantly repeated command. The next
day the Committee returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;You tell us,&#8221; said a professor of theology, &#8220;that God wishes
to free the people of France from their distress. If He wishes
to free them there is no need for the soldiers you ask for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name,&#8221; exclaimed Jeanne with some irritation,
&#8220;the men-at-arms will fight, and God will give the victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a stir among the learned men at this answer. The
professor who had asked the question smiled as though well
pleased, while the King&#8217;s advocate murmured:</p>
<p>&#8220;No clerk of the court could have answered better.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the little flurry had subsided, one Seguin, a Carmelite
friar of learning and repute, next took his turn. He was a
native of Limoges, and spoke the dialect of his district.</p>
<p>&#8220;In what language, Pucelle, do these voices speak to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now this query seemed frivolous to Jeanne. She knew no
language but French, so what other could the Voices use?</p>
<p>&#8220;In a better than yours,&#8221; she flashed, and there followed a
general laugh, for the patois of Limoges was a common subject
of ridicule.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you believe in God?&#8221; continued the friar, nothing
daunted by the mirth.</p>
<p>&#8220;More firmly than you do,&#8221; she replied seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you must know, Pucelle, that God does not wish us
to trust you without some sign that you can do what you say.
Gideon, for a sign, laid a fleece of wool upon the floor, and in
the morning there was dew upon it so that he could wring a bowl
of water from it, while all about the floor was dry; and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
second night the fleece was dry and the floor was wet. So
Gideon showed to the children of Israel, and it was his sign
that he was from the Lord. We can not advise the King to risk
his soldiers just on the strength of your simple word. What
is your sign, Pucelle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name,&#8221; cried Jeanne, now thoroughly worn out, &#8220;I
did not come to show signs in Poictiers; but lead me to Orl&eacute;ans
with few or many men-at-arms, and I will show you the sign
for which I am sent. Attend, and I will tell you also what is to
happen in France: I will summon the English, and if they do
not heed I will drive them from their siege. I will lead the
Dauphin to his crowning and anointing at Reims; Paris will
come into its allegiance to the rightful king, and the Duc
d&#8217;Orl&eacute;ans will return from his captivity; so my Voices have told
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>And of those who heard the words all lived to see the fulfillment
of Jeanne&#8217;s prophecies save only the maiden herself.
During her life but the first two came to pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you call the King the Dauphin, even as the foreigners
do who deny him the right to the throne?&#8221; asked another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he is not the King until he is anointed and crowned
with the sacred oil,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>And so daily for three weeks the questioning continued.
Beside this formal and official examination of her faith and
character, private inquests of all kinds were made concerning
her claims. She was visited by every curious person, man or
woman, in the town or its vicinity, and plied with endless questions,
so that her simple personal story and that of her revelations
became known to all the whole country round about.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
The two Queens, Yolande and her daughter Marie, with their
ladies, took her in hand, and subjected her to an inquiry more
penetrating still than that of the graver tribunals. They inquired
into her history in every subtle feminine way, testing her
innocence and purity. The women were especially interested
about the male attire, and pressed this query. To the Queen&#8217;s
mother, Yolande, she told the reasons.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, your majesty,&#8221; said the maiden simply,
&#8220;&#8217;tis the only dress for fighting, which, though far from my
desires or from the habits of my life, is henceforth to be my
work; this being the case, I am constrained to live among men-at-arms,
and such dress is therefore more seemly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said the Queen thoughtfully; then presently she
nodded an emphatic approval. &#8220;You are quite right, child. I
see it. Others shall see it too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And too,&#8221; spoke Jeanne, smiling at the Queen, &#8220;the habit
matters nothing after all. I must wear it to do what I am
commanded to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yolande went away charmed by the Maid, and reported the
result not only to the waiting women, but also to the learned
Council. &#8220;It was her belief,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that the child was sent
from God.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so said all the women. Jeanne had ever the women with
her. So also said many of the members of the Council who
were growing more and more to believe in the girl. There
were men who were disgusted with the cowardice and treachery
of La Tr&eacute;mouille, and not unwilling to fight for France; the
energy of such men was aroused by Jeanne&#8217;s enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Meantime the friars who had been sent to Domremy to investigate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
her former manner of living now returned to report that
they had found no flaw in her character. At the end of the
three weeks of daily examinations there came a day when
Jeanne was summoned before the whole Board of Doctors to
hear the judgment of the Council. The two faithful knights,
Alen&ccedil;on, and other of her true friends went with her to give
comfort should the verdict be adverse. But Jeanne was bright
and smiling, never doubting for a moment that the result could
be other than in her favor. The King and his adherents had
come also, and Yolande, the Queen&#8217;s mother, beside a great
audience of the people of the town.</p>
<p>After the formal opening, the Archbishop of Reims, who presided
over the Council, rose and read the judgment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The case of the kingdom being desperate we, the members
of the Council, believe that the King should not reject the Maid,
nor should he lightly believe in her. But, in accordance with
Holy Scripture, he ought to make trial of her by two ways, that
is, first, by human wisdom, examining into her character, life,
and intentions; and secondly, by devout prayer, asking a sign
of some divine deed or ground of hope by which he may judge
whether she is come by the will of God.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Maid&#8217;s character has been studied; inquiry has been
made into her birth, past life and intentions; for she has been
examined by clerks, churchmen, men of the sword, matrons and
widows. Nothing has been found in her but honesty, simplicity,
humility, maidenhood, and devotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;After hearing all these reports, taking into consideration
the great goodness of the Maid, and that she declares herself to
be sent by God, it is therefore determined by this Council that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
from henceforward the King should make use of her for his
wars, since it was for this she was sent. The King then, ought
not to prevent her from going to Orl&eacute;ans to show the sign of
heavenly succor, and it is the opinion of this Council that she
may go with the army under honourable superintendence.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was dead silence as the Archbishop concluded the
reading. Dead silence as the people grasped the full significance
of the verdict. The incredible thing had happened.
The peasant Maid had triumphed over the learned Doctors,
even as her own Saint Catherine had triumphed. To the young
girl, barely seventeen, was delivered the marvellous task of
raising the siege of Orl&eacute;ans.</p>
<p>Suddenly the silence was broken by a storm of applause.
Charles rose from his seat and beckoned the maid to come to
him. As she arose to obey the command, the Court and people
rose and stood reverently as a mark of homage and respect.
Charles himself, moved by knightly impulse to do a kingly deed,
descended from the throne, and himself escorted her to the
throne where all might see, then bent low over her hand as
though she were the royal creature and he but the humble
servitor.</p>
<p>But Jeanne, the tears of gladness streaming from her eyes,
fell upon her knees and kissed his hand fervently. For
Charles to her was France; France, represented, embodied, and
made into a living thing&ndash;&ndash;the France she was come to save.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>A wave of enthusiasm swept over the land as the news
of the verdict of the Doctors spread. Cowed
France threw off her cowardice and rose to courage
and activity. Men and arms were now forthcoming for the
army that began to gather at Blois, which was the nearest city
to Orl&eacute;ans that remained in Charles&#8217;s hands. Alen&ccedil;on and
other lords, Yolande, the Queen of Sicily, loyal cities like La
Rochelle opened wide their coffers, and furnished money to
finance the undertaking. An inspired Maid, a Virgin sent
from God was to lead France to victory against the enemy.
Because God had taken pity on the distressed kingdom the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
invader was to be expelled by His maiden messenger. Thus
spoke the people, and men took heart of grace and prepared
joyously to go to the succor of Orl&eacute;ans.</p>
<p>Possession of this city was of the greatest importance to
Charles; for as it lay immediately between the provinces which
had submitted to the English, and those which still acknowledged
his authority, it served as a gathering point for his adherents,
and a stronghold from whence they could with
advantage sally out and annoy their enemies. Unless this
place was taken the English could not with safety pursue the
King into the southern part of the kingdom, and the success of
his cause depended upon its possession. If it were lost, there
was no resource left the monarch but flight. Thus upon the
raising of the siege of the city depended the whole fate of
France; its nationality, its very existence.</p>
<p>A month must pass before the full number of men and sufficient
provisions could be gathered for the expedition, but
Jeanne knew the need of both and was no longer impatient.
From Chinon the Dauphin sent her to Tours to be fitted with
armour, whither she was accompanied by her knights. It was
the most important city in that part of France, and no place
excelled its smiths in the making of armour. Yolande, the
Queen&#8217;s mother, herself designed the armour for the warrior
maiden, which was to be of steel inlaid with silver, burnished
to a shining whiteness symbolic of the purity of the Holy Enterprise.</p>
<p>By Charles&#8217;s desire Jeanne was given a Household as became
a person of her importance. She dwelt with Eleanor,
wife of Jean du Puy, one of the Queen&#8217;s ladies, and her immediate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
attendants consisted of Jean d&#8217;Aulon, a veteran from
Orl&eacute;ans, who acted as her equerry, or squire; the two knights
who had accompanied her from Vaucouleurs, two pages, Louis
de Coutes, and Raimond, while later was added Jean Pasquerel,
an Augustinian friar who was her confessor. Jeanne submitted
to the Household and to the splendor with which she was now
clothed, because it proclaimed the favor of the Dauphin, and
was therefore best for her mission.</p>
<p>But for her standard and her sword she herself gave directions,
for concerning these she had received revelations from her
Voices. When Charles would have presented her with a sword
to replace the one Robert de Baudricourt had given her she told
him of a weapon at Fierbois which her Voices had told her
to use.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have sent a letter to the priests there at Saint Catherine&#8217;s
asking if I may have it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I told them that it would
be found buried in the earth behind the altar. The messenger
should return with it to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it be there,&#8221; he remarked, half laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be, fair Dauphin,&#8221; returned the girl instantly, with
the perfect faith in her revelations that was her strength.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how will they know that it is the sword that you mean?&#8221;
he questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be five crosses on the handle,&#8221; said Jeanne.</p>
<p>The King dropped the subject for the time being, but he
resolved to watch to see if the sword were found where the
maiden said that it would be. He had indorsed her, but he welcomed
further proof of her inspiration. Alen&ccedil;on, La Tr&eacute;mouille
and Queen Yolande were with him beside the peasant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
maiden, and these were listening with great interest to
Jeanne&#8217;s words. And now the favorite spoke, voicing the
thought that was in Charles&#8217;s mind:</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to see this mystic sword, your Majesty,&#8221; he
said, his tones reflecting his scepticism.</p>
<p>The monarch smiled at his favorite without replying, but
Alen&ccedil;on, detecting the underlying mockery, exclaimed with
some heat:</p>
<p>&#8220;By St. Martin! if the Pucelle says that the sword is under
the altar at Saint Catherine&#8217;s, it is there. And who denies it
shall answer to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gently, my cousin, gently,&#8221; spoke Charles lazily. &#8220;There
will be time enough for private quarrel after Orl&eacute;ans. &#8217;Tis not
doubt that made La Tr&eacute;mouille so speak, but a natural desire
to witness the marvel.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this moment there came one who spoke to one of the
gentlemen in waiting, who instantly approached the King.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a man waits without. An armourer
of the city. He has but come from Fierbois, and he
bears a sword which he is to deliver to the Maid whom he has
been told is here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him present himself at once,&#8221; said Charles eagerly.</p>
<p>Amid a hush of expectancy the armourer whom Jeanne had
sent to Fierbois entered, and advanced toward the King. At a
sign from the monarch he handed to him the sword that he
bore. Charles drew the weapon from its sheath and examined
it curiously. It was an ancient blade, and though it had been
cleaned still showed traces of rust. Upon the handle there
were five crosses, as Jeanne had said there would be.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Did the priests know that the sword was there?&#8221; he asked
of the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Sire. They said at first that the Maid must be mistaken,
as they knew of no such sword; but, after much labor and
search, &#8217;twas found just where the Maid said that it would be.
It was very rusty when it was taken from the earth, but when
the priests started to clean it the rust fell away of itself. So
marvellous is the matter deemed that there is a great stir over
it at Fierbois, and the priests have had this scabbard of crimson
velvet made for the Maid to carry the sacred weapon in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The matter is of a truth marvellous,&#8221; commented Charles,
laying the sword in Jeanne&#8217;s eager, outstretched hands. &#8220;But
good blade though it be, Pucelle, it will need sharpening before
it can be used.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne hung her head, blushing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It shall never be used for the shedding of blood,&#8221; she said
reverently. &#8220;I love it already, fair Dauphin, but it shall not
be used to kill. I could not shed blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles smiled slightly at the shamefaced confession. Here
was the maiden anxiously awaiting the gathering of men-at-arms
that she might lead them into battle, yet declaring that
she could not shed blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;And your standard?&#8221; he said gently. &#8220;Did you not say
that you had received divine direction regarding it also?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Jeanne paused reluctant to continue. She
did not understand the reason for the design upon the standard,
and was diffident about telling of it. After some urging, however,
she told Charles the exact design that was to be emblazoned
upon it, and was dictated to her by her saints&ndash;&ndash;Margaret
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
and Catherine, and the monarch had it painted accordingly.</p>
<p>It was made of white linen, a precious fabric at this time, and
over its field were scattered golden lilies. In the midst of it
God was painted holding the world and sitting upon the clouds;
on either side an angel knelt; the motto was Jesus Marie. The
standard was symbolic of her mission: the lilies of France, the
country she had come to save; God, who had sent her; and
Jesus, the Son of Mary, her watchword. On the reverse side
of the standard Charles had fashioned the chosen blazon of
the Maid: a dove argent, upon a field azure.</p>
<p>This was the great standard to be used for the rallying of
all her host. She had also a banner and a pennon. On the
banner was our Lord crucified between the Holy Virgin and
Saint John. This was to be used for the gathering of the
men for prayer and praise after they had confessed and made
their consciences clean. On the pennon was wrought the Annunciation,
the angel with a lily kneeling to the Blessed Virgin.
It was to be used as a signal to those who fought around her
as guards to her body. The standard Jeanne declared that
she would carry herself, which was unusual for one who was to
act as general. But such was the command of her heavenly
guides.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the standard on the part of God, and carry it boldly,&#8221;
they had told her.</p>
<p>While all these preparations were being made Jeanne made
a visit of a few days to Alen&ccedil;on&#8217;s wife and mother at St. Florent
near Saumur. Jeanne of Orl&eacute;ans made Jeanne of D&#8217;Arc
warmly welcome. She was but a young girl herself, daughter
of Charles Duke of Orl&eacute;ans, then nearly fifteen years a prisoner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
in England, whose city the English were besieging, and therefore
had a peculiar interest in the purpose of Jeanne D&#8217;Arc.
She feared, though, for her husband&#8217;s safety, remembering the
three years that he too had been a prisoner to the English, and
she told these fears to Jeanne just as the latter was starting
to return to Tours.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fear nothing, madame,&#8221; comforted Jeanne. &#8220;I will bring
him back to you as well as he is now, or even better.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Jeanne was at St. Florent the two knights, Poulengy
and Metz, had gone with many others from Tours on a pilgrimage
to Our Lady of Puy en Velay; for this year of our Lord,
1429, was the year of Jubilee, as any year was called when
Good Friday and the Annunciation fell upon the same day.
The years in which this occurred were always marked by
strange and great events, and crowds flocked to the church
which was the oldest dedicated to Our Lady.</p>
<p>The morning that the knights were to return Jeanne sat in
an upper room of the house of Jean du Puy, whose wife had
charge of her. It was the room where she received people, and
was connected with the portal by a flight of stairs. There were
many in the chamber, for she was now the commissioned Maid
of War, with much to attend to. Presently her attention was
caught by a commotion in the street below, and there came
shouts and cries, and then the sound of footsteps. Wondering
at the tumult, for,&ndash;&ndash;though many people were always waiting
in the street below to see her come and go; sometimes
striving to get close enough to kiss her hands or any part of
her garments and hailing her as a messenger of hope,&ndash;&ndash;there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
was seldom any disturbance inside the portal. Her amaze
grew as footsteps were heard ascending the stairs. Presently
there came a quick rush of men in haste. As the door was
flung wide a young voice cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne, Jeanne! where are you? We have come to you,
Jeanne.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne uttered a cry of joy as Pierre and Jean, her brothers,
came into the room, followed by the two knights and Father
Pasquerel, her confessor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, boys!&#8221; she cried, trying to clasp both of them in her
arms at once. &#8220;When did you come? How did you get here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We came with the knights and Father Pasquerel from Puy
en Velay, where we went with mother on a pilgrimage. Then
we came on here,&#8221; Pierre told her, giving her a bearlike hug.</p>
<p>&#8220;With mother?&#8221; exclaimed Jeanne in surprise. &#8220;Did
mother go on a pilgrimage to Puy en Velay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; she sends her love and blessing to you. She made
offerings for you there,&#8221; spoke Jean.</p>
<p>&#8220;And father?&#8221; questioned she anxiously. &#8220;How is
father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He grieves over your absence, Jeanne, but he sends his
blessing and love also.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now God be thanked,&#8221; cried the Maid, weeping for very
joy. &#8220;Oh, &#8217;tis good to have you here, boys. Now you two
shall be members of my Household, and be with me wherever
I go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Happy indeed was Jeanne made by the coming of her
brothers. It seemed like bringing her home to her. Now with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
Jean and Pierre with her, and the love and blessing of her
parents she could proceed on her appointed way with light
heart.</p>
<p>By the twenty-fifth of April everything was ready for the
march to Orl&eacute;ans. Jeanne now left Tours and went to Blois
to meet the captains and soldiers. She found a busy scene at
the little town. The roads were full of oxen, cows, sheep and
swine all gathered for the victualling of Orl&eacute;ans. What with
the lowing of the cattle, the bleating of the sheep, and the
riotous noise of the soldiers in camp everything was in an uproar.
Jeanne established her Household, and then sent for the
captains to come to her. Officers of wide renown were they:
De Gaucourt, the old commander of Orl&eacute;ans, whom she had
already met; Rais and Boussac, two marshals of France;
Culent, the Lord admiral; and La Hire, the Gascon freebooter.
They revered her as a saintly child, but left her declaring
among themselves that the Maid would inspire the army with
courage, but as for war&ndash;&ndash;When had there been a woman since
the time of Deborah who had known aught of its art? This
Jeanne found out afterwards.</p>
<p>After this meeting Jeanne sent by a herald to the English
a letter which she had dictated at Poictiers just after the decision
of the Doctors:</p>
<div style="font-size:95%; margin:3% 5%">
<p class='center'>&#8220;JHESUS MARIA</p>
<p>&#8220;King of England, and you, Duke of Bedford, calling yourself
Regent of France, you, William de la Poule, Comte de
Sulford, John, Lord of Talbot, and you, Thomas, Lord of
Scales, who call yourselves lieutenants of the said Bedford,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
listen to the King of Heaven: Give back to the Maid who is
here sent on the part of God the King of Heaven, the keys of
all the good towns which you have taken by violence in His
France. She is sent on the part of God to redeem the royal
rights. She is ready to make peace if you will hear reason and
be just towards France, and pay for what you have taken.
And you Archers, brothers-in-arms, gentiles, and others who
are before the town of Orl&eacute;ans, go into your own country, at
God&#8217;s command; but if you do not, look to hear news of the
Maid, who will shortly go to see you to your great hurt. King
of England, if you will not do this, I am the head of the army,
and wherever I meet your people in France I will make them
flee, whether they will or no, and if they will not obey, I will kill
them all. I am sent from God, King of Heaven, body for
body, to drive you all out of France; but if the soldiers obey, I
will have mercy on them. Be not obstinate, therefore, for you
shall not hold the kingdom of France from God, the King of
Heaven, Son of Saint Mary; from him shall Charles hold it, the
true heir, for God, the King of Heaven, wills it so, and so has
it been revealed by the Maid. If you do not heed the word of
God and the Maid, in whatever place we find you, we will put
you to a greater rout than has been known in France for a
thousand years, if you will not hear reason. And be sure that
the King of Heaven will send greater strength to the Maid and
to her good soldiers than you can bring with all your might, and
then we shall see who has the better right, the King of Heaven
or you. The Maid begs you and bids you, Duke of Bedford,
not to bring destruction on yourself. If you will heed her you
may come in her company where the French shall do the greatest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
work that has ever been done for Christianity. Answer
then if you will still continue against the city of Orl&eacute;ans. If
you do so you will soon recall it to yourself to your great misfortune.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Jeanne the Maid.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>Then into every part of the camp this girl of seventeen
penetrated. Armies of the time were full of brutal license, and
gambling, blasphemy, and other vices were prevalent. Wickedness
of all kinds was the rule. But rude, rough, and lawless
though the soldiers were they had their adorations, and reverenced
holy things. To them the fair young girl was a saint.
They adored her, and talked freely among themselves about her
habits of life. She was good to the poor, she confessed daily,
oftentimes she heard mass three times a day; there was too a
grace of purity about her such as one might bear who descended
from Heaven. So when Jeanne declared that the war was a
Holy War, and that all who followed her must go clean of sin,
gambling and dicing ceased, and men went to be shrived daily.
La Hire, too, fierce ruffian though he was, gave up swearing,
though he begged so hard to leave him something to swear by
that she, having a sense of humor, left him his baton.</p>
<p>All now being in readiness on the morning of the twenty-eighth
of April the army started on its march to Orl&eacute;ans. The
day was bright and beautiful, ideal for the beginning of such
an enterprise. The brilliant sunlight flooded the fields and
meadows gay with wild flowers. At the head of the army
marched a long procession of priests bearing crosses, swinging
censers, with holy banners as on a pilgrimage, and chanting the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
&#8220;Veni Creator&#8221;; the grave and solemn music of the church
accompanied strangely by the fanfares and bugle notes of the
army. Following these came Jeanne on a great white horse
that the King had given her. She was clad in white armour
inlaid with silver&ndash;&ndash;all shining like her own Saint Michael himself.
A radiance of whiteness and glory under the sun&ndash;&ndash;her
uncovered head rising in full relief from the dazzling breastplate
and gorget. With her rode D&#8217;Aulon, her squire, following
immediately after were her own faithful knights, her brothers,
confessor, and pages; while behind them stretched the main
body of the army, a forest of glittering spears, the divisions commanded
by the respective generals. Then came the long train
of carts and cattle to which the army formed an escort. God&#8217;s
Maid indeed seemed Jeanne as she rode, and with hearts beating
high with hope the citizens of the town blessed her as she
passed up the road on the way to Orl&eacute;ans.</p>
<p>Blois was thirty miles from the besieged city, on the right
bank of the River Loire, on which side Orl&eacute;ans was also situated.
It was Jeanne&#8217;s plan, in accordance with directions from
Her Voices, which told her to go forward boldly, nothing doubting,
to go direct to Orl&eacute;ans by the road on the right bank, entering
the city by its western gate, past the English fortifications.
But, knowing nothing of the country, she left the guidance of
the army to her captains, who deceived her.</p>
<p>The English had built a line of strong fortresses called
bastilles around Orl&eacute;ans&ndash;&ndash;fortresses which closed all the gates
of the city but one. To the French generals the idea of trying
to fight their way past those strongholds and lead the army and
supplies into Orl&eacute;ans was preposterous; they believed the result
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
would be the destruction of the army. Jeanne&#8217;s theory of the
art of war was simple; she believed it to consist in attacking at
once the principal body of the enemy, but after the recent experience
at Rouvray the generals hesitated to face their enemies
in the field. The generals therefore decided to march to Orl&eacute;ans
by the left bank of the river. How they were to cross the
river when they came opposite to the city they seem not to have
considered. Intending to use Jeanne&#8217;s trust in the divine favor
to stir up the enthusiasm of their soldiers they did not tell her
their plans, but made her believe that Orl&eacute;ans was situated on
the left, or south, bank of the Loire.</p>
<p>Therefore, crossing the bridge at Blois they marched up the
south bank of the stream. As had been said, it was thirty
miles from Blois to Orl&eacute;ans, and the army passed one night in
the fields. For the first time Jeanne slept in armour, and was
in consequence bruised and chafed. When it is considered that
this armour included a helmet (worn by her only at night); a
neck-piece or gorget; a corselet; hip joints; a kind of skirt of
steel, open in the centre for freedom in riding; strong shoulder
plates; steel sleeve, gauntlets, thigh pieces, knee-joints, greaves,
and shoes; every piece being of steel, the wonder is that a mere
girl could have carried such a weight.</p>
<p>About noon of the succeeding day the army came upon the
heights of Olivet, two miles south of Orl&eacute;ans, from which the
city and the position of the besieging army could be plainly
seen. Then Jeanne saw how she had been deceived. Between
her and the town of Orl&eacute;ans lay the wide river, the broken
bridge, and the camps of the English.</p>
<p>How the cattle and so great a company of men-at-arms were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
to be ferried across under the artillery of the English, who held
the bridge and the strong keep of Les Tourelles which guarded
passage at this point, was a problem. On the further shore the
people swarmed the walls and quays of the city, laboring to
launch boats with sails, and so purposing to ascend the stream
and meet the relieving army. But a strong wind was blowing
down stream and it was impossible to bring up the heavy
barges needed to transport men and provisions, while the army
and the convoy seemed open to attack by Suffolk and Talbot,
who could cross the river safely under the guns of the fort on
the island and the bridge.</p>
<p>Jeanne was bitterly indignant, and spoke her mind pretty
plainly to the generals, to whom the absurdity of their plan was
now apparent. She wished to attack the bastilles of the
English on this side of the river at once, and the soldiers were
eager to follow her, but the generals implored her not to think
of it, as even though these were taken they would not have the
strength to hold them. So again the army took up its march
from Olivet and wended its way up the river to a point six miles
above the city. The march was watched anxiously from the
leaguered city, and so flat was the country that every movement
could be marked after the troops left Olivet. When the expedition
stopped, the Count of Dunois, natural half brother of
the Duke of Orl&eacute;ans and commander of the city, took boat and
rowed up stream and across to meet it. Jeanne spurred forward
to meet the hardy young man, brown of visage, who leaped
from the boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you the Count of Dunois?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and right glad of your coming.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Was it you that gave counsel that I should come by this
bank and not by the other side, and so straight against Talbot
and the English?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I and wiser men than I gave that advice, believing it to be
best and safest,&#8221; he returned mildly.</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name, the counsel of Messire is safer and wiser
than yours.&#8221; She pointed to the water running rough and
strong, a great wind following it, so that no sailing boats
could come from the town.</p>
<p>&#8220;You thought to deceive me, and you rather deceived yourselves,
for I bring you better help than ever came to any captain
or city, the help of the King of Heaven. It is not given for
love of me, but comes from God himself, who at the prayer
of Saint Louis and Saint Charlemagne has had pity on the
city of Orl&eacute;ans, and will not suffer that enemies shall have the
body of the duke and his city also. But have patience. By
the help of God all will go well.&#8221;</p>
<p>And in a moment, as it were, the wind, which was contrary
and strong, shifted, and became favourable, so that each vessel
could now tow two others. Dunois was much impressed by this
signal grace from God, and regarded the Maid reverently.
Then taking advantage of the change he had the heavy barges
towed up the river five miles, where the supplies were embarked
without danger of attack, the army having marched along the
river bank to the same place. As the loaded barges went down
stream to the city, the garrison made a sortie against the
English bastille of St. Loup, to prevent its defenders from
firing upon the flotilla, and thus secured the safe arrival of the
supplies.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></div>
<p>This being accomplished the Count of Dunois wished Jeanne
to return with him to the city. The people were impatiently
awaiting her coming, he said, and it would give them courage
and hope merely to behold her. But Jeanne was reluctant to
leave the army. It had been determined that it should go back
to Blois, and make a new march, returning to Orl&eacute;ans by the
north or right bank, according to the Maid&#8217;s plan. Later it was
found that Jeanne could have taken the army and supplies by
the English forts just as she had designed; for the English
soldiers were in a demoralized condition of superstitious terror.
They too had heard of the coming of the divine Maid, but they
believed her to be a witch in league with Satan. The French
generals did not take this fact into account.</p>
<p>Jeanne feared now to leave her army. She had been deceived
once; how could she know that the captains would keep
the promise to return with the soldiers? Then too she might
lose her hold upon the men if they were without her presence.
So she was reluctant to consent to enter the city. Dunois implored
the captains to promise to return, and to be content without
her, and so save the disappointment of the people. The
captains promised, and so, sending her own confessor, Father
Pasquerel, and the great standard with the soldiers, Jeanne
crossed the river with Dunois, taking with her her Household
and a force of two hundred lances.</p>
<p>It had been noon when they reached the heights of Olivet,
but the march up the river, the transporting of the supplies,
and the return march down the Loire had taken much time,
so that it was nearly eight o&#8217;clock in the evening when she rode
into the city, by way of the Burgundy gate. She was in full
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
armour, mounted on the white horse, with her white pennon, on
which was the Annunciation with the two angels, each bearing a
lily in his hand, carried before her. At her left side rode Count
Dunois in armour, richly appointed, and behind her came her
Household and many noble and valiant lords and squires, captains
and soldiers, with the burghers of Orl&eacute;ans who had gone
out to escort her. At the gate crowds of people were waiting;
the rest of the soldiers and the men and women of Orl&eacute;ans.
All the bells of the city were ringing, and the people laughed,
and wept, and shouted for joy. The Maid, the God-sent Maid
had come; and they rejoiced greatly, not without cause. For
they had endured much labour, and weariness and pain, and
what is worse, great fear lest they should never be succored, but
should lose both life and goods. Now they felt greatly comforted
through the divine virtue of which they had heard in this
simple maid.<a name='FNanchor_0008' id='FNanchor_0008'></a><a href='#Footnote_0008' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a></p>
<p>Through the glare of the torches Jeanne saw the sea of faces
turned adoringly toward her. She stretched out her mailed
hands toward them lovingly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Be of good cheer,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Messire hath taken pity on
your distresses.&#8221;</p>
<p>There came a press to touch her, and to touch even the horse
on which she rode. So closely did the people come that a torch
bearer was pushed against the pennon and the fringe took fire.
Almost instantly Jeanne spurred forward, leaned down, and
put out the flame with her hand, and the people shouted with
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>To the cathedral of Saint Croix the procession wended, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
entering it the maiden returned thanks. Once more the line
of march was taken up, the people accompanying her the whole
length of the city to the house of Jacques Boucher, treasurer
of the duke of Orl&eacute;ans, where she was received with joy. She
was to be the guest of Madame Boucher as long as she remained
in the city. The Squire d&#8217;Aulon, her brothers, the two knights,
and her pages were lodged in the same house.</p>
<p>Jeanne was in Orl&eacute;ans at last, ready to show the sign for
which she was sent.</p>

<p>Jeanne was eager to engage the enemy the next day,
and the citizens would gladly have followed her, but
Dunois and the captains of the garrison did not wish it.
Their argument was that they ought to await the return of the
army from Blois. Jeanne&#8217;s influence in war had not yet begun
to be felt, and so great was the fear of the French for the
English that it was said that two hundred Englishmen could
put eight hundred or a thousand Frenchmen to flight.</p>
<p>Forced into inactivity the Maid sent a herald with a summons
to the English, a procedure common at the time. There had
been no reply to the letter that she had sent from Blois, and
neither had the herald been returned. In this later epistle she
summoned the surrender of the enemy before the attack, demanding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
the return of her messenger. At the same time Dunois
wrote, warning them that any harm that came to the herald
should be retaliated upon the persons of the English prisoners
held by him. In compliance with Dunois&#8217; request the last
herald was sent back, but the English threatened to burn the
other. While the person of a herald was regarded as sacred
by all the usages of war this man from the Armagnac witch
could have no rights, they declared, and should be burned for
his mistress. They laughed at the letter, and gave fierce defiances
to the Maid, calling her a dairy maid, bidding her go
back to her cows, and threatening to burn her if they caught her.</p>
<p>But in spite of these high words there was an undercurrent
of fear in the defiance. The English as well as the French
believed that the latter had supernatural aid, though the
English held that the Witch of the Armagnacs was emissary of
evil rather than of good.</p>
<p>In the afternoon La Hire and Florent d&#8217;Illiers, two of the
captains who had entered the city with Jeanne, with a force of
men-at-arms and some citizens sallied forth from the city and
attacked an English outpost between their fortress of Paris and
the city wall, and drove the men into the main work. They
thought to have burned this, but before they could do so the
English rallied and drove them back without much firing.</p>
<p>Jeanne was not present at this fray, but in the evening she
rode forth, the townspeople crowding about her, and placing
herself on the town end of the broken bridge&ndash;&ndash;called out to
the enemy, addressing them courteously, summoning them once
more to withdraw while there was time. Sweetly and clearly
her voice rang across the water, so that the English who were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
in the fortress called Les Tourelles on the other side of the
bridge could not fail to hear her. Sir William Glasdale,&ndash;&ndash;whom
the French called Classidas,&ndash;&ndash;the knight in charge, came
out on the bridge and answered by hurling a volume of abuse
upon her. Jeanne was not prepared for the foul epithets that
he called her, and for a brief time could not speak, so overwhelmed
was she. Then drawing her mystic sword she waved
it above her head, crying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dost thou so speak, Classidas? Thou who art to die in so
short a time without stroke of sword!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Glasdale and his captains, who by this time had hurried
to the walls to catch sight of the witch, retorted with
such vile words that Jeanne could not restrain her tears, and
wept bitterly. And so weeping she returned to the city.</p>
<p>There being no sign of the return of the army Dunois, fearing
that without the presence of the Maid the favorite and the
Royal Council might so work upon the captains that they
would fail to bring the army back, determined to go to Blois
and bring it himself. On Sunday, therefore, with Jeanne&#8217;s
squire D&#8217;Aulon, he set forth. The Maid, with La Hire and
other captains, accompanied him to cover the departure, taking
a position at the special point of danger between the expedition
and the enemy. But in the towers not a man budged, not a
shot was fired. So Dunois went on his way unmolested, while
Jeanne returned to the town. The citizens had watched for
her coming, and now walked by the side of her charger to the
cathedral, where every progress ended. The press to see her
was at all times great, and Jacques Boucher&#8217;s door was almost
broken in by the eagerness of the people. She could hardly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
move through the crowded streets when she went abroad, and it
seemed that &#8220;they could not have enough of the sight of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an attack could not be made until the return of Count
Dunois with the army Jeanne rode out on Monday to reconnoitre
the position of the English, followed by the captains and
soldiers and a great crowd of townsfolk who seemed to feel no
fear in her company.</p>
<p>On all sides of Orl&eacute;ans the country was very flat. The city
was built close to the northern bank of the Loire in a parallelogram,
slightly irregular on its western side, which curved outward
and joined the northern line at an acute angle. It was
protected by a strong wall from twenty to thirty feet high,
having a parapet and machicolations, with twenty-four towers.
Outside the wall, except where it faced the river, was a ditch
forty feet wide and twenty feet deep.</p>
<p>There were four great gates in the walls that gave upon
roads leading from Orl&eacute;ans. On the north side were two, the
Bannier Gate and the Paris Gate leading to the Paris road; on
the east was the Burgundy Gate and the old Roman road leading
to Jargeau; and on the west, the Regnart Gate upon the
road to Blois. It was through this last named gate that Jeanne
went to make her reconnoissance.</p>
<p>She found that the principal camp of the English was on this
western side. From the river northward, guarding the road to
Blois, there were five great bastilles, joined by ditches and
covered trenches whereby the enemy could easily prevent the
going in of men and convoys of food. The massing of the
greatest number here was necessary, as this road led to the royal
provinces.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></div>
<p>To the northeast the great forest of Orl&eacute;ans crept nearly
to the city walls. About a mile and a half beyond the Burgundy
Gate on the east side was the bastille of St. Loup, which
commanded the road to Checy and on to Jargeau, from which
the English drew many of their supplies. This was one of their
strongest fortresses, and was the only one on this side, for the
reason that this road led to the possessions of the Duke of
Burgundy, who was with the English, and therefore no enemy
was expected from this direction.</p>
<p>On the south, the walls of the city rose directly from the river.
A great stone bridge with arches, buildings and fortifications
spanned the water here, but three of the arches had been broken,
for the English now held the bridge and its fortifications, having
taken it from Orl&eacute;ans early in the siege. On the last pier was
built a strong fortress called Les Tourelles, connected with the
shore of the south bank by a drawbridge, which in its turn was
covered by a strong earthwork or boulevard.</p>
<p>As they held Les Tourelles the English had but three posts
on the left side of the river. One, Champ St. Priv&eacute;, that
guarded the road by the left bank from Blois; Les Augustins,
that was a short distance inland from the boulevard of Les
Tourelles; and St. Jean le Blanc, that was higher up the river,
and was a hold of no great strength.</p>
<p>There had been faubourgs, or suburbs, &#8220;the finest in the
kingdom,&#8221; about the city, but their citizens destroyed them so
that no Englishmen could be sheltered among them. Fifteen
thousand people were thus rendered homeless, and crowded into
Orl&eacute;ans, nearly doubling its population, and threatening all
with famine.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>As Jeanne rode round the city at leisurely pace necks were
craned over the breastworks of the enemy to catch a glimpse of
the witch, but not a shot was fired from the forts. Like a shining
vision she seemed, clad in white armour, riding her white horse,
her head covered by a little velvet cap ornamented with nodding
plumes, her dark hair flying about her face, and though the
English hurled words of abuse at her the lips that spoke them
were pale with superstitious terror. Unmolested Jeanne completed
her survey, then led her people back through the gate
into the city, then to the cathedral to vespers. Here Doctor
Jean de Mascon, a &#8220;very wise man,&#8221; said to her:</p>
<p>&#8220;My child, are you come to raise the siege?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My child, they are strong and well intrenched, and it will be
a great feat to drive them out.&#8221; The wise man spoke despondently.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing impossible to the power of God,&#8221; Jeanne
made answer.</p>
<p>The garrisons of Montargis, Gien, and Ch&acirc;teau Regnard
came marching into the city the next day, bringing word that
the army and convoy from Blois had started on the march for
Orl&eacute;ans.</p>
<p>At dawn of Wednesday, therefore, Jeanne with La Hire and
five hundred of the garrison rode out to meet them. Dunois
was coming by the route that Jeanne had wished to take on her
entry, and it was found to be no difficult matter to make a wide
detour around the forts, skirt the forest at the back of the city
where the English had no bastille, and enter by the Paris Gate.
So, led by the priests, chanting the Veni Creator, as at Blois,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
headed by Father Pasquerel bearing the great standard,
Jeanne entered the city as she had planned to do. Right beneath
the forts of the English they rode and marched, but not
a shot was fired, not a sally was made from the forts. John,
Lord of Talbot, was a brave man, but not even a brave general
can control demoralized and terrified men; men to whom the
slender figure in shining armour seemed like nothing mortal.
By noon Jeanne had her army safely housed in Orl&eacute;ans.</p>
<p>D&#8217;Aulon dined with Jeanne, and while they were seated at
table, the Count of Dunois entered and told the maiden that
there was news that Sir John Fastolf, he who had defeated the
French at Rourvay in the Battle of the Herrings, was coming
from Paris with reinforcements and supplies for the English,
and that it was said that he was but a day&#8217;s march distant.
Jeanne heard the tidings joyfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunois, Dunois,&#8221; she cried, elated that at last action must
come, &#8220;I command you, in God&#8217;s name, to let me know as soon
as he arrives. If you do not, I&ndash;&ndash;will have your head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For that I do not fear, Jeanne,&#8221; replied the Count courteously.
&#8220;I shall let you have the news as soon as it comes.&#8221;
Then he took his leave.</p>
<p>Now there were some of the captains of the city who resented
the enthusiasm with which the maiden had been received.
This was quite natural among men who had been fighting
unsuccessfully for months in defence of the beleaguered
city. Dunois, La Hire, Poton Zaintrailles and a few others
were exceptions to the men who felt jealousy of the Maid, but
the others were sore and wounded by her appearance and
claims. A certain Guillaume de Gamache felt himself insulted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
above all by the suggestion that Jeanne should arrange the
plan of procedure against the enemy.</p>
<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;is the advice of this girl of the fields to
be taken against that of a knight and captain! I will fold
up my banner, and become again a simple soldier. I would
rather have a nobleman for my master than a woman whom nobody
knows.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dunois had tried to placate these men, but vainly. Jeanne,
of course, knew nothing about it. Later she was to be greatly
harassed by these jealousies. Those captains who had not
shared in the expeditions of the morning to meet Dunois and
the army took advantage of the enthusiasm aroused by the entrance
of the men-at-arms under the very guns of the enemy to
make a sortie, unknown to the new leaders. They wished to
show how well they could do without the presence of the Holy
Maid of Vaucouleurs.</p>
<p>Jeanne was wearied by the early morning expedition, and
so laid down in the afternoon by the side of her hostess, Madame
Boucher, and was asleep. D&#8217;Aulon too felt fatigued, and also
stretched himself on a couch for rest. All at once Jeanne
awoke with a wild cry of agitation and alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;My Council tell me to go against the English,&#8221; she cried,
springing out of bed. &#8220;But if to assail their towers, or to meet
this Fastolf I cannot tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then her trouble grew, and her eyes had the rapt look
left in them by her visions.</p>
<p>&#8220;My arms, D&#8217;Aulon! My arms!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Quick! The
blood of our soldiers is flowing. Why did they not tell me?&#8221;</p>
<p>All was quiet in the streets, and there came no sign of conflict
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
on the tranquil air of the May afternoon. But D&#8217;Aulon
leaped to his feet at her cry, and without a word began to buckle
on her armour, assisted by Madame Boucher and her little
daughter. Meantime Jeanne was calling loudly to her page
for her horse. Hurriedly the youth saddled the charger and
brought it to the door. As Jeanne swung herself into the
saddle she perceived that her standard was wanting.</p>
<p>&#8220;My banner,&#8221; she cried, and Louis the page handed it to
her from the upper chamber window. Then with the heavy
flag staff in hand she set spurs to her horse and dashed away
at speed so that the fire flashed from the stones that paved
the thoroughfare. One by one her attendants armed themselves
and clattered after her.</p>
<p>And now came shouts and cries, and all at once the streets
were filled with people who cried loudly that the English were
slaughtering the French.</p>
<p>Straight through the town Jeanne galloped, riding toward
the loudest noise, which proved to be at the Burgundian Gate
on the east side of the city. The gate was open to let in a
rabble of retreating French who were bringing some wounded
men with them. Overwhelmed with pity at the sight Jeanne
paled, and half drew rein.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can never see French blood but my hair rises with horror,&#8221;
she said to D&#8217;Aulon, who had now overtaken her.</p>
<p>Through the gate they passed, and met a disorganized band
of men-at-arms, archers, and burghers flying before the English.
For the coup which had been planned by the captains
was a sortie against the strong bastille of St. Loup, and it had
proven disastrous to those who had undertaken it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></div>
<p>There went up a great shout from the French as they caught
sight of Jeanne as she galloped through the gate. They rallied,
turned, and swept onward after her. Clear and sweet above
the din of battle sounded her bell-like voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends, friends, have good courage. On! On! They
are ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>There never was anything like the response that followed.
The French surged forward upon the English, who had sallied
confidently out of the bastille to meet the first assault, and
swept their foes before them, driving them back into their
fortress. Gallantly the English fought, but they were no
match for men imbued with divine ardour by the Maid. Everywhere
in the thick of battle the shining figure appeared, encouraging
and urging the men to greater efforts. Against the
formidable walls of the bastille the French hurled themselves
with irresistible fury. Back and forth the tide of battle surged;
back and forth, for the English made a desperate resistance.
Back and forth until the vesper hour when, with a mighty rush,
the French carried the place by storm. St. Loup was taken.
Before the English camp on the west side could hurry reinforcements
around the walls the bastille was sacked, riddled,
burned. The English were cut off from Jargeau.</p>
<p>Dizzy with the first victory that had been theirs in years the
soldiers and burghers re-entered the city with banners flying,
proudly displaying the prisoners and captured munitions.
And the city went wild over the Maid who had wrought the
miracle. La Hire, Dunois, Poton Zaintrailles, Rais and Boussac
were ready to follow wherever she might lead. The citizens
pressed upon her as she rode, adoring and worshipping. All
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
the bells in the city rang joyfully, and in the churches soldiers
and citizens alike &#8220;gave thanks to God by hymns and devout
orisons.&#8221; It was Jeanne&#8217;s first battle, and she wept as she
prayed for those who had died unshriven. As she rose from
her confession she said to Father Pasquerel:</p>
<p>&#8220;In five days the city shall be delivered; but I shall be
wounded on Saturday, here.&#8221; And she placed her hand upon
a spot between her neck and shoulder.</p>
<p>Thursday being the Feast of Ascension and a holy day there
was no fighting. To Jeanne, whose mission was a holy one,
it seemed right that the success of the day before should be
followed up by an attack upon one of the English fortresses,
but the captains pleaded the sanctity of the day, so none was
made. But, while Jeanne confessed and took the Sacrament,
exhorting the soldiers to do likewise, the captains held a Council
at the house of the Chancellor of Orl&eacute;ans, Cousinot, taking
care that news of it should not come to Jeanne.</p>
<p>They decided that a feigned attack should be made upon
the strong bastille of St. Laurent, which stood just beyond the
Regnart Gate on the west side, which should draw off men
from the forts beyond the river. When this was done the main
body of the French would attack the weakened bastilles on the
south bank and overcome them. The Maid, at the head of the
burghers, was to make the feint while the nobles and their levies
were to make the real assault across the Loire. But Jeanne
was to be told no word of their design lest she should reveal the
intention to the enemy.</p>
<p>When they had come to this conclusion Ambroise de <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''Lore'' in original text">Lor&eacute;</ins>
was sent to bring the Maid to the Council, and when she came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
in answer to the summons, Chancellor Cousinot himself told
her they were to attack the great fortress of St. Laurent, and
that she was to lead the attack. But of their real purpose he
said no word. Jeanne&#8217;s acuteness told her that something was
being withheld, but she said nothing until he had made an end
of the telling. Then she spoke quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it that you have really decided? Why do you fear
to tell me what it is? I can keep a greater secret than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne, do not be angry,&#8221; spoke Dunois. &#8220;We cannot tell
you everything at once. What the Chancellor has told you is
true, but if the men in the bastilles go to the aid of those in
the great fort we intend to cross the river, and fall upon
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne professed herself satisfied, and so the matter rested.
But no part of the plan was carried out. That evening she
made her last summons to the English. Going to the end of
the intact part of the bridge, where the people of Orl&eacute;ans had
erected a fort, she called across the water to the English in the
Tourelles, telling them that it was God&#8217;s will that they should
withdraw from France.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall write no more,&#8221; she said as she fastened a letter to
an arrow and directed an archer to shoot it into the fortress.
&#8220;I would have sent this in more honourable fashion, but you
keep my herald, Guienne. Return him and I will return my
prisoners taken at St. Loup.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;News from the Armagnac wench,&#8221; shouted a soldier as he
ran forward to pick up the missive. &#8220;Cowgirl! Witch!
Only let us catch you, and you shall burn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne could not keep back her tears as she heard these insults,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
but calling the King of Heaven to her aid, she was soon
comforted, and smiled through her tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have tidings from Messire,&#8221; she called back. &#8220;The English
shall depart, but you, Classidas, will not see it, for you
will be dead. Without stroke of sword shall you die.&#8221;</p>
<p>The English hooted and jeered at these words, and hurled
taunts and foul epithets upon her, and having given her last
summons Jeanne returned to the city.</p>
<p>She rose early the next morning and confessed to Father
Pasquerel, who said mass for all the Household; then she set
forth followed by her personal attendants and a multitude of
citizens who were in armed readiness.</p>
<p>The secret that the true attack was to be made on the forts
across the river had somehow leaked out, but not through
Jeanne. A number of burghers had been present at the Council,
and they had not approved of the plan. When Jeanne appeared
there was no word said about attacking the great fort
of St. Laurent, but with one accord all took a line of march
toward the eastern side of the city to the Burgundy Gate,
which the troops must pass through in order to cross to the
south bank of the river.</p>
<p>That the captains intended to carry out the design and
make their assault without Jeanne and the townspeople was
evidenced when they reached the gate. It was closed and
guarded by De Gaucourt with some men-at-arms. Angry
murmurs arose as the people saw their former governor with
his men drawn up in formidable array, and Jeanne cried
quickly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentle sir, in God&#8217;s name, open the gate, and let us pass.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I cannot, Jeanne,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have orders from the Council
to keep it closed, and closed it shall remain.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this a shout went up from the citizens, and they moved
toward him threateningly. They were in no mood for interference.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are an evil man to prevent these people from going,&#8221;
cried Jeanne. &#8220;But whether you will or no, the men shall go,
and they shall prevail as before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gaucourt hesitated. As he glanced at the stern faces of the
citizens, who were determined to fight their way through, if
necessary, he saw that he stood in peril of his life. With
the ready wit of a soldier he threw wide the gate, crying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, I will be your captain!&#8221; And the people rushed
through.</p>
<p>Just above the bridge of Orl&eacute;ans there was a broad island,
called St. Aignan, lying quite close to the south bank of the
river, with a narrow swift passage of water between it and
the shore. A little higher up the Loire, on the left side, stood
the small fort of St. Jean le Blanc, which the English had
built to guard the road. The plan of the captains was to cross
by boat to the island, and thence by a bridge of planks laid on
boats to the southern shore, and so make an assault on St. Jean
le Blanc. It would be a task of some hours to bring troops,
horses, and artillery, so the townsfolk being lightly encumbered
crossed first. When the English captain of the bastille saw
the boats put out he abandoned the post, and retired to the
Bastille of St. Augustins, opposite the Tourelles. When the
townspeople found the post undefended they were wild with
enthusiasm, and, without waiting for Jeanne, marched on at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
once to Les Augustins, and attacked it. They were no match
for the disciplined English, who rushed out to fall on them. Instantly
the old dread fell upon the citizens, and they became
panic-stricken, fleeing in a disorganized rabble before the
enemy, while De Gaucourt, their old governor, covered their
retreat gallantly. Slashing, slaying, and hurling taunts and
gibes at the routed French the English came on a run.</p>
<p>At this moment Jeanne and La Hire, who had been having
difficulty with the horses in getting them across the improvised
bridge, reached the shore. Seeing the rout of the French they
mounted hastily, and then these two, the Maid with her banner,
La Hire with lance at rest, charged the English. The
English turned and fled incontinently at sight of the white
figure on the white horse. The fleeing townsfolk rallied,
turned, and following the men-at-arms, who had succeeded in
crossing by this time, went after the Maid and the valiant La
Hire, and chased the English back into their works.</p>
<p>Swiftly following Jeanne planted her standard under the
fort of the Augustins, in the moat, and the assault begun.
The English fought bravely, and again the French were repulsed.
And Jeanne was everywhere, inciting the men to
greater deeds by her inspiriting cry. At length the rest of
the main body of troops came up with the artillery, and the assault
redoubled in vigour.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm was with the French. Onset after onset
was made. Knights vied with each other in feats of valour.
A giant Englishman who gallantly defended the open gate was
presently shot down by Jean the Lorraine gunner, and instantly
Jeanne&#8217;s clear, girlish voice rang out:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Enter! Enter boldly! They are ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a terrible onslaught the French rushed in upon the defenders.
A few of the English escaped to the boulevard of
Les Tourelles, an earthwork connected by a drawbridge with
the pier upon which the Tourelles stood; the rest were slain
or taken. Great deeds at arms had been performed on both
sides, and the victory was hard bought, but the Bastille of St.
Augustins was taken. The sun was setting, and setting also
was the glory of England in France. Verily God was speaking
through His Maid.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>For fear that the men would fall into disorder while
plundering the fortress Jeanne had the buildings of the
Augustins burned. On the morrow the Tourelles must
be attacked and taken, and the men must be in readiness for
it. For this reason they were to encamp for the night on the
hard won field. Jeanne wished to remain with them so that
she might be ready to push the assault in the early morning;
then too, she feared that a night attack might be made by the
English, which of course was the proper procedure for the
enemy. Jeanne always foresaw what an opposing force ought
to do, and then tried to forestall it. But La Hire and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
captains besought her to return to the city and seek the services
of a leech.<a name='FNanchor_0009' id='FNanchor_0009'></a><a href='#Footnote_0009' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> She had been wounded in the foot by a
chausse-trape (a small piece of iron, which, falling in any position,
turned a foot-piercing point uppermost). Both English
and French lances carried them as part of their equipment.
To be ready for the great work of the next day she must have
proper rest, they told her. Finally the maiden consented, and
with most of the captains and squires crossed the river to the
town. The archers with a body of citizens remained on the
field.</p>
<p>It was Friday, and Jeanne was wont to fast on that day, but
on this night she broke her fast and ate a little meat, for she
was worn and weary. While she was eating a knight came
to tell her that the captains were in Council, and that it had
been decided that enough had already been done; that their
forces were too much inferior to those of the English to hazard
an attack upon the Tourelles the next day; that God had
greatly favored them already, and that now it seemed wisest
to await reinforcements from the King. The town was now
well victualled and could afford to wait. Therefore, it did not
seem best to the Council to fight the next day.</p>
<p>Jeanne heard the announcement with quiet disdain.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been with your Council,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I have
been in mine, and you may believe that the counsel of my
Lord, the King of Heaven, shall prevail, while councils of your
sort shall come to naught. Get up early to-morrow morning,
fight your best, and you shall accomplish more than you have
done to-day.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></div>
<p>As the knight left she turned to her confessor, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Rise to-morrow even earlier than to-day. Do your best to
keep near me, for to-morrow I shall have yet more to do, and
much greater things. To-morrow also blood will flow from
my body here.&#8221; And again she placed her hand upon a spot
above her right breast between her neck and shoulder.</p>
<p>The Maid was up early the next morning, but early as it
was some of the burghers were waiting to see her. They had
heard the decision of the captains not to fight, and had held a
meeting of their own. They were not minded to wait for reinforcements
from the King, they said. They had been in
siege for seven months, and had nothing but broken promises
from the King and his Councillors. Therefore, as God was
with her, and had sent them succour through her it seemed madness
not to avail themselves of the divine favour. And they
besought her to go out against the enemy that day in spite of
the captains, and so accomplish the mission with which she had
been charged.</p>
<p>Jeanne needed no urging, but answered them with solemn
intensity:</p>
<p>&#8220;Be of good cheer. In God&#8217;s name I will go against the
English to-day. And the captains will go also, and will fight
with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The delighted burghers departed to spread the tidings, while
the maiden ran down to the courtyard to mount her charger,
followed by her attendants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay, Jeanne,&#8221; spoke her host Jacques Boucher, coming
into the yard with a large fish, a shad, in his hand. &#8220;This is
for your breakfast. Wait until it is cooked before you go.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
You need food before starting upon so great an enterprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep it until supper, messire,&#8221; cried the girl gaily. &#8220;I
will back a Godon to share it with me, and to-night, gentle sir,
I will come back by the bridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-night, Pucelle? That may not be, for an arch of the
bridge is broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne laughed again without replying, and was off. The
decision of the captains not to fight had been far from unanimous.
There were those who felt that the assault ought not to
be postponed, and who were desirous of following the Maid, for
over some of them she had gained great influence. Consequently
when the great standard appeared in the streets, and
the Maid with her company was making for the Burgundy
Gate these men gladly flocked to her. Dunois, La Hire,
Florent d&#8217;Illiers, Poton Zaintrailles, Gaucourt, and many others
crossed the river with her; there were some who remained
in the city to guard it against attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will have much to do, more than ever I had,&#8221; Jeanne had
said the night before. In truth it was no easy task that lay
before the French.</p>
<p>There was first a supporting work called a boulevard, on the
south bank of the Loire, on solid land, to be taken before the
Tourelles could be assailed. Its rear communicated with the
bastille by a drawbridge, under which ran a deep, swift strip
of the river. It was strong, with high walls and surrounded
by a deep fosse. Should it be taken the garrison could retire
by the drawbridge to the Tourelles which, being shut off by
the Loire into an islanded position was considered impregnable.
Its six hundred men, the pick of the English army, were made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
a host by their captain, Sir William Glasdale, a brave and
valorous knight. To drive such a man from such a position
would be no light feat. The garrison was amply provided with
cannon and small arms, and were full of determined courage.</p>
<p>The French were as well equipped as the English with
everything necessary for the attack: arrows and crossbolts,
and all small arms, &#8220;pavoises,&#8221; or strong wide screen shields,
and movable wooden shelters to protect the advance of small
advancing companies of assailants, cannon, ladders, beams for
the ditches, and all the munitions of war. The French had the
advantage in numbers over the English, but the latter were
possessed of a seemingly unconquerable position.</p>
<p>The French army, whom the men of Orl&eacute;ans had been busy
all night feeding and encouraging, lay in the morning sunlight
waiting for the leaders. When Jeanne and the captains
appeared there was instantly the bustle of activity. With
D&#8217;Aulon carrying her standard, accompanied by her faithful
knights, her brothers and pages, the Maid passed through the
ranks and took up her place on the border of the moat of the
boulevard. About her the army was arranged in companies
under its several captains, each flying its own standard.</p>
<p>At six o&#8217;clock the assault began by a bombardment of the
boulevard by the artillery, the stone balls of the cannons being
thrown sometimes as far as the Tourelles itself. From the
town the guns kept up a constant fire against the fortress.</p>
<p>With uncalculating valour the French made the assault,
varying the bombardment by furious sorties against the walls.
The noise of attack and repulse was terrific. From every side
the onset was made. Stooping forward with their shields
slung over their backs for protection the French ran up the
scaling ladders in swarms, attacking the men at the top with
such hardihood that the English cried in amazement:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do they think that they are immortal?&#8221;</p>
<div class='figtag'>

&#8220;FRANCE AND ST. DENYS!&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></div>
<p>Again and again the ladders were flung down, the climbers
were shot, or smitten, or grappled with and dashed into the
fosse. Valiantly the English fought with bow-shot and gunshot,
with axes, lances, bills, and leaden maces, and even with
their fists, so that there were many killed and wounded. But
like Antaeus, of whom it was fabled that being a son of the
goddess, Tellus, or the earth, every fall he received from Hercules
gave him more strength, so the French returned to the
charge after every repulse with such vigour that it was marvellous
to behold. The air was filled with shouts and cries of the
captains: &#8220;France and St. Denys!&#8221; &#8220;St. George for England!&#8221;
It whirled to the singing of arrows, the twang of bowstrings,
the clang of axes on armour, and the roar of guns.</p>
<p>Exposed to all the dangers of the fray Jeanne stood, her
clear girlish voice sounding high above the din and confusion
of battle:</p>
<p>&#8220;Be of good cheer. The hour is at hand!&#8221;</p>
<p>But after many hours of desperate fighting the spirit of the
assailants began to flag. Seeing this the Maid seized a <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''scaling-ladder'' in original text">scaling ladder</ins>,
and placing it against the walls started to mount amid
a rain of arrows and stones. As she did so she cried clearly:</p>
<p>&#8220;On, on! Be of good courage! They are ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a shout the French swarmed over the fosse with their
ladders until there seemed a forest of ladders against the walls.
Up Jeanne mounted, still crying out encouragements, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
then&ndash;&ndash;all in a moment a bolt whizzed, and uttering a cry of
terror and pain the maiden reeled and fell. A great Hurrah!
went up from the English&ndash;&ndash;a mighty shout of triumph and rejoicing.
The witch had fallen, and with her went the mysterious
force that had overwhelmed them. She was slain, or if
not killed her blood was shed, which forever spoiled her witchcraft;
for such was the superstition. Therefore they rejoiced,
and renewed the defence with confidence.</p>
<p>It was De Gamache, the captain who had said that he
would not follow a girl of the fields whom nobody knew, who
raised her, and carried her back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take my horse, brave creature,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Bear no malice.
I confess that I was in the wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is I that should be wrong if I bore malice,&#8221; cried Jeanne,
&#8220;for never was knight so courteous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her own people had followed her when she was carried out
of the fray. The bolt stood out a hand-breadth behind her
shoulder, and the maiden wept with the pain. She was General-in-Chief
of the army, but she was seventeen, and after all
but a girl, so she cried just as any girl would have done. Some
one of the soldiers proposed to charm the wound with a song
of healing, but the maiden cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;I would rather die than do so, for it would be sin.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then, because none of her attendants would drag the
bolt from her shoulder for fear of hurting her, she herself pulled
it out, and as the blood gushed out she swooned. Father Pasquerel,
who was surgeon as well as priest, dressed the wound
with a compress soaked in oil, and Jeanne, recovering from her
faint, made her confession to him, then lay quiet.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></div>
<p>Meantime the battle languished. Discouraged assailants
were drawing back from the boulevard out of bow-shot, and
Dunois himself thought that there was no hope of victory, the
day being nearly spent, and the men weary. So he had the
recall sounded, and gave orders to retreat across the river.
Brave work had been done, and the captains had not hoped to
take the place in a month. The bugle notes of the retreat were
welcome music to the English, and to the wearied French who
had fought without cessation for thirteen hours. But when
they sounded on the ears of the wounded Maid she heard them
with amazement.</p>
<p>She rose in haste, and somehow managed to mount her horse,
and so rode to Dunois.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doubt not,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They are ours. Rest a little. Eat
something. Refresh yourselves, and wait for me a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that she withdrew into a little vineyard close by, and
prayed for the half of a quarter of an hour. When she appeared
again her eyes were shining, her whole appearance that
of one inspired.</p>
<p>&#8220;On,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;the place is ours.&#8221; And she spurred toward
the fosse.</p>
<p>Now her standard had not been removed from the edge of
the moat, for D&#8217;Aulon had kept it there to be a terror to the
English and an inspiration to the French. When the trumpets
had sounded the retreat he, being weary and outworn, had
handed it to a Basque to be carried in the retirement. But
after the order for the recall had been countermanded by
Dunois at the request of the Maid, D&#8217;Aulon, moved to do a
feat of arms, said to the Basque:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If I dismount and go forward to the foot of the wall, will
you follow me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said the Basque.</p>
<p>So D&#8217;Aulon leaped into the fosse, his shield up, defying the
English, but the Basque did not follow; for Jeanne, seeing her
standard in the hands of a man whom she did not know, thought
that it was lost, and seized hold of the floating end.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! my standard! My standard!&#8221; she cried, and as she
and the Basque struggled for it, the banner waved wildly like
a signal for an immediate onset. The men-at-arms conceived
it to be such and gathered for the attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, Basque! Is this what you promised me?&#8221; cried
D&#8217;Aulon, and the Basque tore the banner from the Maid, ran
through the ditch and stood beside the emblem. By this time
Jeanne&#8217;s company stood about her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Watch,&#8221; said she to the knight at her side. &#8220;Watch till the
tail of the standard touches the wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few moments passed. The great standard fluttered with
the movements of the Maytime breeze. Presently the knight
cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne, it touches!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then enter,&#8221; cried Jeanne her voice thrilling through the
air. &#8220;In God&#8217;s name, enter! All is yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>The troops rose as one man, and flung themselves against
the walls. Up they swarmed, &#8220;as thick as a cloud of birds
lighting on a bush,&#8221; says the old chronicle.<a name='FNanchor_0010' id='FNanchor_0010'></a><a href='#Footnote_0010' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a> &#8220;Never was assault
so fierce and wonderful seen within the memory of living
man.&#8221; The English, amazed at the new onset, defended themselves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
valiantly, but the French were irresistible. The defenders
became panic-stricken as the French swarmed over the top
of the earthwork. Panic-stricken, not by the enemy but by
that white figure standing there beneath her standard, the rays
of the setting sun striking a dazzling radiance from her shining
armour. The witch was there. They had thought her
dead, yet there she stood without sign of injury.</p>
<p>&#8220;A crowd of butterflies hangs about her,&#8221; a soldier cried in
terror, throwing down his weapon and turning to flee into the
Tourelles.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; it is a dove,&#8221; gasped another who followed him.</p>
<p>Arrows flew on every side of the maiden, but never touched
her, and on the French sped, incited to superhuman effort by
the bell-like voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;On, on! All is yours!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the boulevard was taken.</p>
<p>Showering down blasphemies Glasdale stood on the drawbridge
making a desperate effort to save his men by covering
their retreat over the bridge into the Tourelles. Suddenly a
foul smoke rolled up from the river, suffocating all who stood
with him. The citizens had loaded a barque with sulphur and
all manner of evil smelling things, and floated it under the
drawbridge. Presently tongues of flames shot up from it,
licking the rafters of the drawbridge, and darting through the
planks, while all about them fell the stone bullets of the guns
of Orl&eacute;ans, lighting on the roofs and walls of the Tourelles,
and splashing in the waters of the Loire. Jeanne&#8217;s quick eye
saw the men&#8217;s danger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Classidas! Classidas!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Yield thee, yield thee
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
to the King of Heaven. I have great pity on thee and thy
people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the compassionate voice died away the bridge bent
under the rush of armoured men, and broke. Glasdale and his
companions plunged downward into the great river and were
seen no more, for the weight of their armour, the fire and the
water all conspired against them. And at the sight Jeanne
broke down and wept, then kneeling began to pray for their
souls.</p>
<p>Yet the greater part of the surviving English had succeeded
in reaching the fortress, but here they found themselves assailed
from another quarter&ndash;&ndash;Orl&eacute;ans. The gap whence the
arches had been broken had been spanned by gutters and beams,
and through the smoke and dusk came the knights from the
city, <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''asaulting'' in original text">assaulting</ins> the Tourelles from that side. The struggle was
soon over. Of all the stout defenders of the fort not one escaped;
all were slain, drowned, or taken and held to ransom.
Talbot with his English in the forts before the city had heard
the French trumpets sound the recall, and had believed that
the battle was over. Now the flames of boulevard and bridge
blazed out the story of a new defeat.</p>
<p>The bells of Orl&eacute;ans pealed forth joyously as Jeanne re-entered
the town by the bridge, as she had said she would do.
The streets were crowded with people so that it was with difficulty
that she could make her way through them. They
pressed about her as closely as they could, to kiss her hand, her
greaves, her mailed shoes, her charger, or the floating folds of
her banner, while others went before her, crying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Room! Room for the Maid of Orl&eacute;ans!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>She was no longer the holy Maid from Vaucouleurs or Domremy,
she was their Maid; the Heaven-sent deliverer of their
city; their Maid whom God had raised from among His poor
for their salvation; their Maid, and so she has remained, and
always will remain&ndash;&ndash;The Maid of Orl&eacute;ans.</p>
<p>Through all the delirious joy Jeanne rode in a maze of happiness,
fatigue, languor, pain, and profound pity for the souls
of those who had gone unshriven to their maker. She stopped
only to return thanks in the Church of St. Paul, and then rode
to her lodgings, and went to bed.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning she arose and, weak from her wound,
put on a coat of armour lighter than she had worn, and with
Dunois and the captains marched out of the Regnart Gate,
for the English had come out of their fortresses and were drawn
up outside in battle array. The confident French soldiers were
eager to attack them, but Jeanne was reluctant to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us not attack them, for it is Sunday,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But
if they attack you, fight bravely, and you will get the better of
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>She then sent for an altar and a priest, and bade him celebrate
mass in front of both armies. When one mass was done, she
bade him celebrate another, both of which she and the French
and English soldiers heard with devotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and see if their faces are set toward us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;They have turned their backs
and are retreating toward Meung.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name, let them go,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Our Lord does
not wish us to fight them to-day. You shall have them another
time.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></div>
<p>La Hire with a hundred lances followed the English and
found that the retreat was genuine. They had collected their
prisoners and all the property they could carry, leaving their
sick, their heavy guns and ammunition, huge shields and provisions
behind them. Jeanne&#8217;s first herald, Guienne, was
found bound to a stake preparatory to burning him. The English
but waited for the decision of the University at Paris before
the execution. Before it had time to arrive the siege was
raised.</p>
<p>The army of the French returned to the city and gave
thanks, and made a procession; for they were delivered of the
ancient enemies of the realm.<a name='FNanchor_0011' id='FNanchor_0011'></a><a href='#Footnote_0011' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a></p>
<p>That which had been declared impossible was done. The
siege of Orl&eacute;ans was raised. Jeanne D&#8217;Arc had shown her
sign.</p>

on the eighth of May. It was suspended for a short time during the French
Revolution, but resumed afterward. Since 1429 the day has been considered as
belonging to the Maid, and so throughout the centuries it has been observed.
Orl&eacute;ans does not forget Jeanne D&#8217;Arc.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>After a few days&#8217; rest Jeanne set forth for Chinon,
where the King still remained. To raise the siege of
Orl&eacute;ans and to lead the Dauphin to his crowning and
anointing were the two charges laid upon her. She had performed
the first, and wished now to accomplish the latter.
There was too a lack of provisions and money, the troops were
dispersing, and the help of Charles was needed if the army were
to be kept together. After the fall of each bastille news had
been sent to the King by the citizens, and he in turn forwarded
the tidings to all the good towns that held for him. &#8220;The Maid,
who was always there in person at the doing of these things,&#8221;
is the only leader mentioned in the dispatches.</p>
<p>Consequently a royal welcome awaited Jeanne at all the
towns through which she and her company passed. As she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
drew near to Tours she was amazed to see the King, accompanied
by some of the courtiers, ride forth to meet her. As
soon as she saw him the maiden set forth at speed to greet
him, bowing low in her saddle. But Charles reached forth his
hand and lifted her, bowing in turn before her as though she
were a queen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rise, dear Maid,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and receive our welcome and our
thanks for what you have done. It was a great deed, most
gloriously performed. Such prowess merits rich reward; therefore
speak, and say what poor return Charles may make for
such services.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne looked at him eagerly with all her soul in her eyes.
There was but one desire in her heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentle Dauphin, the only boon I crave is leave to lead you
to your crowning and anointing at Reims. Out of your goodness
I beg you to let us set forth at once; for now is the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At once?&#8221; The indolent monarch shrank from the suggestion,
and there were murmurs among the courtiers, who did
not wish anything to occur to interrupt their amusements.
La Tr&eacute;mouille, the favorite, interposed quickly:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is impossible, my dear Maid. His Majesty&#8217;s person
should not be exposed to such risks. Why, the road is filled
with English and Burgundian strongholds. An army strong
enough to open the way should first be raised, and that would
take six weeks to equip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But now is the time,&#8221; cried Jeanne, dismayed that there
should be delay. &#8220;We should strike now before the Duke of
Bedford has time to send them reinforcements. If we wait
our task will be but the harder.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Patience, patience, Jeanne,&#8221; spoke the King soothingly.
&#8220;We will go, we promise you, but not just now. You are
wounded too, we hear, and sadly need the rest. So have patience
for a little, we beseech you.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Jeanne was forced to curb her eagerness while the King
dawdled away the precious days in idle pleasure. She had
spoken truly: the time was ripe for action. Charles had but
to mount and ride and all was his at a blow. Had he but gone
straight to Reims, after Orl&eacute;ans, and thence on to Paris, every
city would have opened its gates to him. So obviously was this
the thing he ought to do that, supposing it would be done, the
Duke of Bedford left Paris and shut himself up in the strong
castle of Vincennes, dreading an uprising among the people.
Then next he wholly withdrew to Rouen, for he had no force of
men to guard the walls of Paris. But through the influence of
La Tr&eacute;mouille, Regnault de Chartres, the Archbishop of
Reims, and Raoul de Gaucourt, the former governor of Orl&eacute;ans,
the golden opportunity was lost.</p>
<p>It was no part of the policy of these men to allow the King
to shake off his indolence, and from this time forth they set
themselves to thwart the peasant Maid who so amazingly upset
their plans and schemes. It was never English or Burgundians
whom Jeanne had to fear the most. They were open enemies,
and with a good company of men-at-arms she could overcome
them. It was the constant efforts of these foes at Court that
undermined her influence and neutralized any advantage that
she might gain.</p>
<p>The campaign of Orl&eacute;ans had been allowed. La Tr&eacute;mouille
was willing that the city should be relieved, if it could be done
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
without danger to his power, but the completeness of the girl&#8217;s
victory had aroused his opponents, and there was a dangerous
current of French patriotism awakening which, unless subdued,
meant the overthrow of himself and his party. It was said of
him truthfully that he had &#8220;a foot both in the Burgundy and
French camps,&#8221; and the present state of France suited him
admirably. So Jeanne found herself opposed by these
wretched politicians in her plans for the redemption of her
country. Her true friends were the gallant captains of the
armed companies that accompanied her on the campaigns, and
the simple people who believed that she had a mission from
Heaven, and was inspired by saints and angels.</p>
<p>Thus, longing for the dash of action that would drive the
enemy from the land, Jeanne was thrown into the frivolity of
the Court instead. A fortnight was spent by Charles in
lengthy debates with his Counsellors, and in a round of pleasures;
then he removed to Loches, some thirty miles from Tours,
where there was a grim fortress better suited to his humours
than a city. Being a part of his household, Jeanne went also.</p>
<p>In every place that she entered the people crowded about
her horse, and tried to kiss her shoes or her hands. The Abbot,
Robert le Macon, one of those who had examined her at
Poictiers, reproved her sharply for allowing these manifestations,
and told her that it was making the people idolatrous.</p>
<p>&#8220;In truth,&#8221; answered Jeanne, smiling at him, &#8220;I should not
know how to guard myself from these things, unless God
guarded me. They love me because I have never done them
any unkindness, but helped them as I could.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles tried by means of rich gifts to make the maiden content
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
to remain in idleness, and so to cease from importuning
him to set forth for his anointing. But, though Jeanne delighted
in pretty clothes and presents, as was natural in a young
girl, she never for one moment lost sight of her mission. Nor
did she abstain from entreating the Dauphin to go to Reims.
And now Alen&ccedil;on and Dunois, her good friends, came to the
Court, and added their pleas to hers that he should set forth
for the crowning, but Charles did not discover the hurry to
save his kingdom that they did.</p>
<p>Greatly distressed by the waiting, one day Jeanne&#8217;s patience
reached its limit. Knowing that the King was in Council with
Sir Christopher d&#8217;Harcourt, Gerard Machet, his confessor,
Robert le Macon and Dunois, she went boldly to the door of
the Council Chamber, and knocked. Being admitted she went
at once to the monarch, and threw herself at his feet, clasping
his knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Noble Dauphin, you hold so many and such long Councils,&#8221;
she cried. &#8220;Rather come to Reims and receive your worthy
crown.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does your Counsel tell you to say this?&#8221; asked d&#8217;Harcourt,
the Bishop of Castres.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Jeanne. &#8220;The Voices urge this chiefly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you not tell us in the presence of the King the nature
of this Counsel?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne blushed and hesitated before replying. Then she
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand what it is that you wish to know, and I will
gladly satisfy you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne,&#8221; said Charles kindly, &#8220;it would be very good if you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
could do what they ask in the presence of those here; but are
you sure that you are willing to speak about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sire,&#8221; she answered simply. Then she turned to them,
and spoke with visible emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I am vexed to find myself disbelieved in the things
I say from God, I retire by myself and pray to God, complaining
and asking of Him why I am not listened to. And
when I have finished my prayer I hear a Voice saying:
&#8216;Daughter of God, on, on! I will help thee. On!&#8217; And
when I hear the Voice I have great joy. I would that I could
always feel thus.&#8221;</p>
<p>The maiden&#8217;s face shone as she spoke, &#8220;lifting her eyes to
Heaven, and she was in marvellous ecstasy,&#8221; so that the men
who heard her were dazzled, and sat speechless looking on.
Then all in a moment there came a change. Jeanne&#8217;s features
worked, and she was overcome by emotion. She turned toward
the King beseechingly, and cried brokenly:</p>
<p>&#8220;The time is so short. Oh, use it, use it, sire. I shall last
such a little while: only a year and little more. Oh, sire, &#8217;tis
such a little time to work for France.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles was deeply moved, as were also those with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Maid,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will go whenever you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Robert
le Macon interposed softly:</p>
<p>&#8220;When the roads are clear between here and Reims. Your
Majesty. It would not be wise to risk your person on an uncertainty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me clear the road, noble Dauphin,&#8221; exclaimed the
maiden quickly. &#8220;I beseech you, out of your grace to grant me
leave to do it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There still remain the strong places on the Loire which will
have to be broken up,&#8221; remarked the King dubiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can be broken up. Then you can march.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you have our permission to do it, Jeanne,&#8221; said the
monarch, half laughing. &#8220;Never was there such an indefatigable
little soldier!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When may I begin, sire?&#8221; Jeanne&#8217;s delight was plainly
evident. The delay was over; action might begin. No wonder
she rejoiced.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as you please,&#8221; Charles told her graciously.</p>
<p>Joyously the girl left the room, and began immediately the
task of gathering the army together; the army that had been
forced to disband through the inertia of its King. A tide of
popular enthusiasm arose as soon as it became known that the
English towns on the Loire were to be attacked, and from all
quarters came men eager to fight, with or without pay; beginning
again to hope for their country and aroused by the Maid&#8217;s
exploits before Orl&eacute;ans. Selles, a town of Berri, about fifteen
miles from Loches and about fifty miles south of Orl&eacute;ans, was
chosen for the recruiting camp.</p>
<p>Thither, among other nobles, came one day the two young
Counts de Laval: Guy and his brother Andr&eacute;, who could not
rest until they had seen Jeanne. Their father had been slain
at Agincourt, and they had been brought up by their mother,
who had defended their castles against the English, and by
their grandmother, in her youth the wife of the great constable,
Bertrand Du Gueselin, who had done great deeds for France.
Full of boyish enthusiasm for the Maid, they wrote home to
their mothers, telling them of Jeanne:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She seems a creature wholly divine, whether to see or hear.
Monday at vespers she left Selles to go to Romorantin, three
leagues in advance of the army, the Marshal of Boussac and
a great many soldiers and common people being with her. I
saw her get on horseback, armed all in white, except her head,
with a little battle-axe in her hand, riding a great black courser,
which was very restive at the door of her lodgings, and would
not let her mount. So she said, &#8216;Lead him to the cross,&#8217; which
was in front of the church near by, in the road. There she
mounted without his budging, just as if he had been tied. And
she turned to the church door and called in her sweet woman&#8217;s
voice: &#8216;You priests and churchmen, make processions and
prayers to God.&#8217; She then set out on the road, calling, &#8216;Forward!
Forward!&#8217; with her little battle-axe in her hand, and
her banner carried by a page. Her brothers went with her,
all armed in white.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Romorantin Jeanne and Alen&ccedil;on, who had been given
the command under the Maid, were joined by Dunois and
other captains, and together they entered Orl&eacute;ans on the Ninth
of June. The people received her with joy, and set about
supplying her impoverished army with supplies and artillery,
making their gifts directly to the Maid whose courage and
wisdom they had cause to know. They were grateful for
their deliverance, but to make that deliverance secure the Loire
must be cleared of the strongholds that menaced it. The first
point of attack was Jargeau, which lay above Orl&eacute;ans on
the south bank of the Loire, about ten miles. It was connected
with the north bank by a bridge, which was the only
bridge across the river between Orl&eacute;ans and Gien, and was held
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
for the English by the Earl of Suffolk, one of the commanders
before Orl&eacute;ans, who had retreated into this place after the
raising of the siege. Ten miles below Orl&eacute;ans lay Meung,
which also had a fortified bridge, and six miles below Meung
was Beaugency, with a bridge also fortified. Both these places
were held by the English, Talbot being in Beaugency, and
Lord Scales, his lieutenant, being in Meung. The next bridge
across the river was at Blois, which was French, so that the
English could cross either above or below Orl&eacute;ans into the
Dauphin&#8217;s provinces. By bringing large reinforcements into
these places the siege of Orl&eacute;ans could be renewed at any time
by the English. It was the part of wisdom to clear them of
the enemy.</p>
<p>As has been said, the first point of attack was Jargeau, for
the reason that news was brought that Sir John Fastolf was
proceeding toward it with reinforcements, and it was Jeanne&#8217;s
plan to attack it before he could reach it. It was a strong
place. After Jeanne left Orl&eacute;ans Dunois had stormed it unsuccessfully
for three hours, and Suffolk had strengthened its
defences. Its garrison was experienced in all the arts of war.</p>
<p>On the eleventh of June the advance was begun on the town,
and on the way the associate commanders were seized with hesitation,
using many arguments to get the Maid to postpone the
attack. To which she replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;Success is certain. If I were not assured of this from God,
I would rather herd sheep than put myself in so great
jeopardy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men of Orl&eacute;ans were in the van, and, encouraged by the
marvellous success of the month before, rushed to the attack
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
without waiting for the men-at-arms or the artillery, and tried
to storm the place. The garrison easily beat them off, and
charged upon them, driving them back to the main body.
Then Jeanne rode forward, standard in hand, and led the
men-at-arms to the rescue. The English in turn were driven
back, the French occupied the environs to the very ditch, and
passing the night there, after the Maid had summoned Suffolk
to yield peaceably to the Dauphin.</p>
<p>The next morning the artillery was placed and Alen&ccedil;on wondered
audibly at Jeanne&#8217;s expertness in laying the guns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where got you such skill in military matters, Jeanne?&#8221; he
exclaimed. &#8220;Who taught you where to set those guns?
You go to work as though you were a captain of twenty or
thirty years&#8217; experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my Lord who tells me,&#8221; answered Jeanne, regarding
him with reverent look in her large grave eyes. &#8220;When I see
a place I know at once where the artillery should be placed.&#8221;</p>
<p>At which the young duke&#8217;s wonder grew; for he knew that
she had never seen ordnance until at Orl&eacute;ans the month before.
While the captains were planning the mode of attack word
came that the Earl of Suffolk was parleying with La Hire,
offering to surrender if not relieved within fifteen days, no
doubt believing that Fastolf would arrive with reinforcements
before that time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell them that they may leave in their tunics, without arms
or armour,&#8221; cried Jeanne. &#8220;Otherwise the place will be
stormed at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>The terms were refused by Suffolk, and immediately the cannon
began their work. One of the towers of the town was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
destroyed, and the sharpshooters of the French picked off some
of the garrison with their culverins. The English too used
their artillery with telling effect. As Jeanne and Alen&ccedil;on
stood watching the bombardment, she cried out to him suddenly,
recalling the promise she had made his wife to bring him back
safe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Change your position. That gun will kill you!&#8221; pointing to
a gun on the walls. Alen&ccedil;on stepped aside quickly, and a few
moments later a gentleman was killed on that very spot.</p>
<p>Soon Jeanne urged an assault on the walls, which Alen&ccedil;on
believed to be premature. He thought that the artillery should
continue the bombardment before the attack should be made,
and was therefore reluctant to follow. As the trumpets
sounded the assault, and he did not advance, Jeanne turned
upon him quickly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you hesitate?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Doubt not! When it
pleases God the hour is prepared. God helps those who help
themselves.&#8221; As he still hesitated she added: &#8220;Ah, gentle
duke, are you afraid? Do you not know that I promised your
wife to bring you back safe and sound?&#8221; Thereupon they both
rushed to the attack.</p>
<p>As the body of the men rushed into the fosse to plant the
scaling ladders Suffolk tried to parley, but it was now too late.
The English resistance was effective and stubborn, so that for
several hours the struggle went on with Jeanne in the thick of
it. The ditch was bridged and, banner in hand, the Maid
started up one of the scaling ladders as at the Tourelles and
tried to mount the wall. One of the garrison threw down a
stone which crashed through the banner, struck on the light
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
helmet that she wore, and stretched her stunned to the ground.
For a moment only she lay, and then springing to her feet unhurt,
she cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends, friends, on! On! Our Lord has condemned
the English. They are ours! Have good courage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The French had learned that cry. They knew that victory
awaited them, and swarmed over the walls in a rush that carried
all before them. Suffolk retreated toward the bridge, hoping
to escape across it into the Beauce, but the French followed
him too closely. One of his brothers and many of the garrison
were slain, but he and all who were left alive were captured.
As Suffolk was surrounded a knight cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yield thee, Suffolk! Yield thee, rescue or no rescue!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will yield to none but the most valiant woman in the
world,&#8221; answered Suffolk proudly. And he would give his
sword to none other than Jeanne herself.</p>
<p>So Jargeau was taken.</p>
<p>The town even to the churches was sacked, and Jeanne found
herself powerless to prevent the sacrilege, but she profited by
the experience. Some of the prisoners had been butchered
because their captors had quarreled over the right to ransom
them, so that it was deemed best to send the other captives down
to Orl&eacute;ans by boat during the night. This was another lesson
that Jeanne took to heart.</p>
<p>Alen&ccedil;on and Jeanne returned in triumph to Orl&eacute;ans, where
the burghers gave them a royal welcome, making them many
presents. Among Jeanne&#8217;s were a hucque and a rich robe of
the Orl&eacute;ans colors, green and crimson. In the old times the
green had been bright and clear, but it had darkened after the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
murder of Duke Louis by Jean Sans Peur of Burgundy, and
since Agincourt was almost black. The hucque was of green,
and the robe, or overcoat, was of crimson &#8220;cramoisy&#8221; lined with
white satin and embroidered with the device of Orl&eacute;ans, the
nettle.</p>
<p>With Meung and Beaugency still left to attack Jeanne felt
the necessity of immediate action. Sir John Fastolf was at
that very time at Janville, only twenty-five miles&#8217; distant from
Jargeau; since that town had fallen he would press forward to
Talbot&#8217;s assistance. The Maid permitted but one day of rest
in Orl&eacute;ans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we must go to see the English at Meung,&#8221; she told
Alen&ccedil;on. &#8220;We will march <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''tomorrow'' in original text">to-morrow</ins> after dinner. Give
orders to that effect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meung, as has been said, was the nearest fortified town to
Orl&eacute;ans down the river, being distant some ten miles. Its
bridge was a mile upstream from the town, and well fortified.
It was attacked the afternoon of the next day, as Jeanne had
desired, and fell easily. Placing a French garrison in the
bridge towers the Maid with her forces camped for the night in
the fields and next morning passed on down the river to Beaugency.
These towns with their castles and towers were very
conspicuous on the flat plain of the Loire; and bodies of men
were easily seen by the watchmen on the walls. As soon, therefore,
as the English saw the French approaching they did
not try to defend the town, but retired into the castle, leaving
men ambushed in houses and sheds to surprise the French.
They were under command of Matthew Gough, a brave Welshman,
for Talbot, having no force sufficient to meet the enemy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
in the field, left Beaugency and rode off with a small company
to Janville to hasten the coming of Fastolf. As the French
marched into the town the men hidden in the houses fell upon
them, but with losses upon both sides were driven into the castle.
Jeanne placed the guns, and battered the castle until evening,
when news came that was disturbing; for the Constable of
France was advancing with a force of men and wished to
join her.</p>
<p>The Comte de Richemont, Constable of France, was a great
nobleman and a famous leader, but at the present time was in
disgrace with the King and exiled from Court, largely through
the machinations of La Tr&eacute;mouille and his party. He had
wished to assist in raising the siege of Orl&eacute;ans, but the King
had forbidden it, and consequently his approach caused both
Alen&ccedil;on and Jeanne disquietude.</p>
<p>He was no friend of Jeanne&#8217;s, believing it to be a disgrace to
France that her armies should be led and victories gained by a
woman, probably a witch, a creature unworthy to stand before
armed men. The Constable could hardly be blamed for holding
this opinion of the Maid; excepting those who came in personal
contact with her such belief was general. The captains
and soldiers reverenced her, holding that she was truly sent of
God; the simple people had no doubt of it. The English believed
firmly that she was a witch. The Regent Bedford in his
report to England concerning the failure of the siege of Orl&eacute;ans
said that it was caused by &#8220;false enchantments and witchcraft of
a Maid.&#8221; Richemont was a sworn enemy to all such.</p>
<p>The French generals were divided over the advisability of
receiving him. He was own uncle to Alen&ccedil;on, and the latter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
had no personal quarrel with him, but the King&#8217;s command
was that Richemont should not be received should he come with
his force. Alen&ccedil;on, therefore, declared that he would withdraw
should the Constable&#8217;s aid be accepted. It was an embarrassing
moment. Jeanne herself did not regard his coming
with much pleasure, but it was not her way to reject any champion
of France. So, as just at this time news was received of
the advance of the English under Talbot and Fastolf, she persuaded
Alen&ccedil;on that they ought to accept the proffered aid
gladly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is French, my gentle duke,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And Frenchmen
ought to lay aside private quarrels for France. In God&#8217;s
name, then let us welcome him.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end this wise counsel prevailed, and both Jeanne and
Duc Alen&ccedil;on rode forth to meet the Constable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne,&#8221; said Richemont, as the maiden alighted from her
horse to greet him, &#8220;they tell me that you are against me. I
know not whether you come from God&ndash;&ndash;or elsewhere. If from
God, I do not fear you, for He knows my good will; if from
the Devil, I fear you still less.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brave Constable,&#8221; returned the maiden, smiling, &#8220;you are
not here by any will of mine; but since you are here you are
welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>They then mounted and rode back to Beaugency. Immediately
they were obliged to make ready for battle, for Talbot
and Fastolf had come up with their forces, and rested at a spot
between Meung and Beaugency, distant about a league from
each town. The French army took up a strong position on a
hill in front of Beaugency, covering the siege of the castle and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
the town. Night was coming on, but the English formed in
line of battle, and waited for the French to begin the attack.
From their excellent position the French watched the enemy&#8217;s
preparations, but made no move to fight. Becoming impatient
the English sent two heralds, saying that three English knights
would fight any who would come down into the plain. Jeanne
declined the challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to your rest to-day,&#8221; she sent back word. &#8220;It is late
enough. To-morrow, if it please God and Our Lady, we shall
see you at closer quarters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later, scouts reported to Jeanne and the French captains
that the English were withdrawing from their position in the
plain, and were headed northward.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are going to Meung,&#8221; cried the Maid joyfully.
&#8220;They will occupy the town, and try to take the bridge, thinking
to come down on the other side of the river, and so relieve the
garrison here at Beaugency in that way. But Beaugency will
surrender as soon as it hears the news that Talbot has gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which proved to be the case. Matthew Gough, upon learning
that the English army had retreated, felt that his case was
hopeless. He had seen that Alen&ccedil;on was reinforced by the
Constable, and believed that Talbot had left him to his fate.
Therefore, at midnight he capitulated on easy terms. His
men with their horses and armour, and goods to the value of a
silver mark, were allowed to march away, on the condition that
they were not to fight against the Dauphin for ten days; he
himself was held as hostage.</p>
<p>At dawn the French were up and away to Meung, where they
found that Talbot had indeed been battering the bridge held by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
the French all night long, but the bridge held. On receipt of
the news that Gough had surrendered Talbot and Fastolf with
all the united forces of the English set off across the wooded
plain of Beauce, as the country north of the Loire was called,
for Paris.</p>
<p>The French were uncertain what to do. An encounter in
the open field, an open hand-to-hand battle between the French
and the English, had heretofore resulted in victory for the
English. Such a thing as the French holding their own and
attaining victory over the enemy had never been known.
They would rather avoid an engagement than risk such a disaster.
To arrive at an understanding Alen&ccedil;on assembled the
captains for a Council of war. He turned to Jeanne first.</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall be done now?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have good spurs,&#8221; she told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; he cried astonished. &#8220;Are we to turn our backs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nenni,&#8221; answered she, laughing. &#8220;The English will not
defend themselves, and you will need good spurs to follow
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a murmur at these words; a murmur of confidence
for the prophecy put heart into men who had been wont to fly
instead of pursue. Eagerly now they prepared to follow the
retreating English. La Hire and Dunois with a company of
eighty men, mounted on the best horses, rode in advance, and
the main body of the army came more slowly. Jeanne preferred
going with the vanguard, but the leaders feared that
they might run into an ambush, and would not permit the risk.
Jeanne was angry over this. She liked the thick of the fight,
and chafed at following, but it was well that she remained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
with the main body, for the men needed encouragement.</p>
<p>It was a long ride and a dangerous one. The wide plain
was covered by a dense growth of underbrush and trees, and
there was danger of an ambush. Not an Englishman was
visible. Cautiously the French made their way, and some of
the captains began to show signs of uneasiness. Jeanne encouraged
them constantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name we must fight them; if they were hung in
the clouds we should have them, for God has sent them to us
that we might punish them.&#8221; And again:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fear naught. This day the gentle Dauphin shall have the
greatest victory he has ever won; my Counsel have told me that
they are ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pursuit continued until near Patay, a town standing
midway between Meung and Rouvray, where Fastolf had won
the Battle of Herrings in February. La Hire and his scouts
were scouring the country to get trace of the English, but without
success. All at once they roused a stag as they rode, and,
startled, the animal bounded away before them, disappearing
into some bushes which grew as a hedge by the roadside. Instantly
there came a shout from English voices&ndash;&ndash;a cheer of delight
as the creature plunged among them, and, not suspecting
that the French van was so near, they began to fire upon it.</p>
<p>La Hire drew rein, and sent back a messenger to the main
army to hurry forward. Then with a shout he and his company
spurred forward, and charged the English before they
had time to form, or to set up their usual defenses.</p>
<p>Now Talbot had been marching in three bodies. First, the
advance guard; then his artillery; then his battle corps a good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
way in the rear. When he was within a league of Patay some
of his scouts reported that a large body of the French was
advancing toward him. Seeing that he could not escape without
some fighting he posted his advance guard with the wagons
and artillery behind some strong hedges which would cover
their front from the French cavalry. He himself with five
hundred archers halted in a place where the road through which
the French must pass was bordered on both sides by a hedge.
Here he stood waiting for the enemy, waiting too for his main
body of troops under Sir John Fastolf to join the train, when
the advent of the stag discovered his presence to the French.</p>
<p>The English archers were thrown into wildest confusion and
disorder by the suddenness of the onslaught. Slashing and
slaying, the French cut them down, pressing onward toward
the advance guard of the English with the wagons and artillery.
Sir John began to gallop toward the advance guard, but to
the latter he seemed to be fleeing before the enemy. Panic
seized them, and leaving the provisions and guns the troops
broke and fled, utterly demoralized, on the road toward Patay.
Talbot himself fought with desperation and rage, to be thus
overcome a second time by a girl whom he believed to be a
pernicious witch, but was finally taken prisoner by Poton Zaintrailles,
while his men fled and were killed in their flight.
Fastolf turned back to the field, hoping to die there or be captured,
but his escort dragged him off, and at length he too rode
off toward Paris. His men were cut down at the will of the
victors.</p>
<p>The Battle of Patay was won.</p>
<p>But it was a bloody field, for slaughter of fugitives who were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
not valuable followed. Jeanne had never seen such a massacre,
and &#8220;she had great compassion on the victims.&#8221; Meeting a
Frenchman who was brutally using a prisoner she flung herself
from her horse, indignant that he should be subjected to such
treatment, and seating herself beside him lifted his bleeding
head upon her lap. Sending for a priest that he might have the
last comforts of religion she comforted him with womanly tenderness
until he died.</p>
<p>Jeanne wanted the English out of France. She fought them
that she might achieve that end. She had steeled herself to the
necessity of war, but pity was always enthroned in her heart.
A wounded enemy appealed to her tenderness as much as one of
her own countrymen would have done.</p>
<p>And so ended a great week of wonders. Between June
eleventh and eighteenth the Maid had delivered three strong
towns from the English, and routed them in open field. All
the Loire and the waterway was now in the power of France.
But it was not Alen&ccedil;on, nor Dunois, nor the French generals
who had secured the victories. It was the dauntless girl, the
peasant maid in whom was more of the divine than human&ndash;&ndash;she
who after a scarce month of war bore herself like the &#8220;most
skilled captain in the world who all his life has been trained to
war&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0012' id='FNanchor_0012'></a><a href='#Footnote_0012' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a>&ndash;&ndash;this girl of seventeen who bade fair to be the best

</td></tr></table>
<p>The next day, which was Sunday, Jeanne and her men
returned to Orl&eacute;ans in triumph, and were &#8220;nobly
received.&#8221; The streets were crowded with people who
were wild with joy at sight of the Maid, and who gave her a
tempestuous welcome. They formed processions and went to
the churches, where &#8220;they thanked God and the Virgin Mary
and the Blessed Saints of Paradise for the mercy and honor
which Our Lord had shown to the King and to them all, and
saying that without the Maid such marvels could not have been
done.&#8221;</p>
<p>To all parts of France the news of the victory of Patay was
carried with incredible quickness, and everywhere the loyal
towns celebrated the event by singing Te Deums, by processions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
and prayers, by bonfires and by bell ringings. But the
tidings that brought such rejoicing to the hearts of the French,
caused consternation among the partisans of Burgundy and
England. On Tuesday when Sir John Fastolf and other fugitives
brought the story of the disaster of Patay into Paris, there
was a riot, and many believed that the victorious French were
coming at once to attack the city. Had this been true the
town must have fallen, for the English troops were thoroughly
demoralized. Rank and file were filled with superstitious terror
of the Armagnac Witch, and the Duke of Bedford was at
the end of his resources.</p>
<p>In Orl&eacute;ans the exultation was greatest, for Jeanne was
counted their Maid, and the people expected that their King
would come to greet her and start for his crowning from that
city. Consequently the burghers decorated the streets and
prepared to give him royal welcome, but he did not come. He
was at Sully being entertained by La Tr&eacute;mouille, frittering
away his time in pleasure while a girl fought his battles for him.
Jeanne, therefore, after a few days of rest left Orl&eacute;ans to join
him and to urge his instant departure for Reims. She met
him at St. B&eacute;noit-sur-Loire on his way to Ch&acirc;teauneuf.
Charles was exceedingly gracious, showering her with praise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonderfully you have wrought, Jeanne,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Greatly have you earned our gratitude. What guerdon shall
be yours for these amazing labors?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sire, that you will start at once for Reims to be crowned is
all that I desire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will go, dear Maid. We promise you, but now you
must rest. Greatly have you endeared yourself to us, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
above all we desire your welfare. Therefore, rest from these
labors to please your King.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Jeanne had just taken three fortified towns, and had
cut a great army to pieces. In smaller towns and fortresses
the citizens had risen and driven their English garrisons out
of the gates upon receipt of the news of Patay, so the golden
lilies floated over the cleared country of the Beauce nearly to
Paris. She had done all this that the Dauphin might safely
march to Reims. She had been told that if the Loire were
cleared the march would be begun, and now he wished further
delay. It was too much for the girl, who longed so ardently to
complete her mission, for she knew that her time was short,
and she burst into tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne, ma mie, what is it?&#8221; asked the monarch, disturbed
by her emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, gentle Dauphin,&#8221; she said brokenly, &#8220;you are not King
until the sacred oil shall anoint you. Doubt no longer, but
come to your sacring. The whole realm shall be yours when
you are consecrated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will go, beloved Maid, and that right soon. But you?
Is there not some gift or boon that you wish other than this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sire, forgive the Comte de Richemont, and receive him
again at Court, I beseech you. Great aid did he give us at
Beaugency, and at Patay. For the sake of France, Sire, grant
this favor.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Charles shook his head. At this moment Alen&ccedil;on and
Dunois drew near and added their pleas to Jeanne&#8217;s that the
Constable should be forgiven, but the King was obdurate. So
Richemont, who had helped to administer the greatest blow to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
English domination that had ever been given, was rejected
once more. He had remained at Beaugency to await the result
of the embassies, and had even sent two of his own gentlemen
to La Tr&eacute;mouille to plead that he might be allowed to serve
the King in the state of the country. But all his overtures were
refused, so he withdrew to his own estates, and Charles lost a
good soldier.</p>
<p>And Jeanne, to her amazement, for she had given every sign
required of her, found herself opposed by almost incredible difficulties.
The King was plainly reluctant to act, and seemed
averse to taking a decided step of any kind. From every
point of view the march to Reims and the accomplishment of the
great object of her mission was the wisest and most practicable
thing to do. But there were delays and parleyings. Had the
maiden not been sustained by her Voices and her duty to her
country she would have been discouraged.</p>
<p>But all France was rousing, and was beginning to call upon
the King in no uncertain tones. It was said that the Maid
would lead the Dauphin to his crowning if she were allowed;
that after the deeds she had wrought she should be given the
opportunity. La Tr&eacute;mouille recognized a dangerous note in
the general talk, and a Council of War was held in which it was
decided to risk an advance. Gien was chosen as the base for
the army, and Jeanne went to Orl&eacute;ans to bring up the troops
and munitions that were left in that city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sound the trumpet, and mount,&#8221; she said to Alen&ccedil;on on the
twenty-fourth of June. &#8220;It is time to go to the noble Charles
and start him on his way to be consecrated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which was easier said than done. There were many of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
Councillors who wished to besiege La Charit&eacute; and other small
towns on the upper Loire, which would have profited nothing;
still others were for a bold move into Normandy to attack the
English at Rouen, where they were strongest. But Jeanne
insisted that the Dauphin should march to Reims. Her Voices
had told her to take him there to be crowned that the people
might know that he was the true King, and to the maiden, sublime
in her faith, that was the thing to do.</p>
<p>It was objected that there were many cities and walled towns
and strongholds well guarded by English and Burgundians in
the way, but she answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it well, and all that I hold as naught.&#8221;</p>
<p>Worn out finally by the futile arguments and the wasting of
so much precious time, when all hope lay in a quick advance
against the enemy before Bedford could bring over new troops
from England, Jeanne left the Court, and went to her army
which lay in the fields near Gien. There was comfort there,
for the soldiers declared that they would go wherever she
wished to lead them. There were princes of the blood among
the men; great lords, and knights, and squires of high and low
degree. They had come from all parts of loyal France bringing
their companies, eager to serve, for the &#8220;great hope of the
good that should come to the country through Jeanne, and they
earnestly desired to serve under her, and to learn her deeds, as
if the matter were God&#8217;s doings.&#8221; There was little or no pay
for the men, but enthusiasm took the place of money. Jeanne&#8217;s
exploits had made her a personage, and not only France but all
Europe was rife with curiosity concerning her, and her deeds.
Many were attracted to the army by her fame, and it was said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
though not openly, for no man was bold enough to speak against
La Tr&eacute;mouille at this time, that if the Favorite would permit it
an army large enough to drive every Englishman out of
France could be raised.</p>
<p>On Monday, the twenty-seventh of June, Jeanne crossed the
River Loire with part of the army, and on Wednesday the
King and his Councillors reluctantly followed her. The
march upon Reims had at last begun.</p>
<p>Fifty miles to the eastward of Gien was the town of Auxerre.
It was under Burgundian allegiance, and if it admitted the
Dauphin, had good reason to fear Burgundy. So its gates
were closed upon the approach of the King and his army.
Jeanne and the captains wished to attack it at once, but the
town sold food to the troops and sent bribes to La Tr&eacute;mouille
to exempt it from assault. The bribes were accepted, though a
mere military demonstration would have opened its gates, and
the army passed on, the town giving some sort of a promise to
submit if Troyes, and Ch&acirc;lons, and Reims should acknowledge
the King. Other smaller strongholds on the road yielded upon
being summoned, and presently Charles and his army were
before Troyes.</p>
<p>It was the capital of Champagne, about forty miles to the
northeast of Auxerre. The whole province was greatly excited
by the advance of the royal forces, and those who held for the
English were much alarmed. The cities were not sure of each
other, and each feared to be either the last or the first to open
its gates to the King.</p>
<p>So, during the march toward it, Troyes sent letters to Reims
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
saying that it had heard that the latter would submit to the
Dauphin, but that its own citizens would do nothing of the sort,
but would uphold the cause of King Henry and the Duke of
Bedford even to the death inclusive.</p>
<p>Now Troyes had reasons for taking this bold stand. It was
the place where the treaty which had given France to England
had been signed; where the French princess, Catherine, was
married to Henry Fifth of England, and where the Dauphin
was disinherited by his mother. The burghers had arrayed
themselves with the Burgundians and the English after the
treaty, and feared now that if Charles were admitted to their
city he would wreak vengeance upon them.</p>
<p>Charles stopped at Saint Phal, within fifteen miles of Troyes,
from which place both he and Jeanne sent the burghers letters.
The King demanded that they should render the obedience they
owed him, and he would make no difficulty about things past for
which they might fear that he should take vengeance; that was
not his will, but that they should govern themselves toward their
sovereign as they ought, and he would forget all and hold them
in good grace.</p>
<p>Jeanne&#8217;s letter was to the people, in which she summoned
them to their allegiance in the name of the Sovereign Lord
of all. They must recognize their rightful Lord who was
moving on Paris by way of Reims, with the aid of King Jesus,
she said. If they did not yield the Dauphin none the less would
enter the city.</p>
<p>The letters were received at Troyes on the morning of the
fifth of July, and copies were at once sent to Reims with assurances
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
that the city would hold out to the death, and begging the
men of Reims to send at once to Burgundy and Bedford for
assistance.</p>
<p>The royal army meantime camped before the walls for several
days, hoping that the town would surrender. There were a
few sallies which resulted in nothing of importance. The
burghers held off, expecting the same terms would be given them
that were granted Auxerre. After nearly a week the supplies
of the besiegers began to get low. The Dauphin could not
provision his troops at Troyes, and Gien, his base of supplies,
was thirty leagues away. He could not pass on to Reims and
leave the town in his rear, for so strongly garrisoned a place
would be a menace, and the state of the army was becoming
seriously grave. So Charles called a Council to consider what
were best to be done, but Jeanne was not asked to attend.</p>
<p>Regnault Chartres, Archbishop of Reims, was for retreating,
and a number of Councillors were against assaulting the city.
One after another they gave their opinions, some arguing that
if they did not retreat it would be best to leave the hostile
fortress in their rear and press on towards Reims. When it
came the turn of Robert le Macon, the old Chancellor of
Charles VI, he said that the march had been undertaken in
reliance neither upon the number of their troops nor upon the
richness of their treasury, but because the Maid advised them
that such was the will of God. He suggested, therefore, that
she be called to the Council. At this moment Jeanne, becoming
impatient over the long debate, knocked at the door. She
was at once admitted, and the Archbishop of Reims took it upon
himself to explain:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne,&#8221; said he, &#8220;the King and his Council are in great
perplexity to know what they shall do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I be believed if I speak?&#8221; asked the maiden, who was
learning from experience that even messages from Heaven may
be set aside by the will of man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can not tell,&#8221; replied the King, to whom she addressed
herself; &#8220;though if you say things that are reasonable and
profitable I shall certainly believe you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I be believed?&#8221; she asked again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the King, &#8220;according as you speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Noble Dauphin, order your people to assault the city of
Troyes, and hold no more of these Councils; for in God&#8217;s name,
before three days I will bring you into Troyes, by favor or
force, and false Burgundy shall be greatly amazed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne,&#8221; said the Chancellor, &#8220;we might well wait if you
could do that in six days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doubt it not,&#8221; spoke Jeanne, addressing the Dauphin only.
&#8220;You shall be master of the place, not in six days but to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Council broke up, and Jeanne began at once to make
preparations for storming the place. The whole army was
set to work during the night, nobles and men-at-arms alike,
to collect any kind of material, faggots, palings, tables, even
doors and windows&ndash;&ndash;anything that could be used to shelter the
men, mount the guns, and fill up the fosse. She worked hard
all night, and the unusual commotion gave notice to the townsfolk
that something out of the ordinary was being done, and
they retired to the churches to pray. In the morning they saw
that arrangements had been made to assault the place, and heard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
the Maid&#8217;s voice order the attack to begin. At this great fear
of her came upon them, and they had no heart to man battlement
or tower. Whereupon the Bishop of the town and the
citizens threw the gates open and made submission without
firing a shot, sending a committee to Charles to treat for terms
of peace. The King received the envoys graciously, and guaranteed
all the rights of Troyes, promising that the garrison
might depart with their arms and goods, providing the town
were given up to him.</p>
<p>Jeanne of course was obliged to acquiesce in the terms that
her King made, but she was suspicious of the good faith of the
Burgundian garrison, and so stationed herself at the gate to
see them march out. She had been up all night &#8220;laboring with
a diligence that not two or three most experienced and renowned
captains could have shown,&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0013' id='FNanchor_0013'></a><a href='#Footnote_0013' class='fnanchor'>[13]</a> and she was weary, but
she would not retire to her tent until she knew how the garrison
complied with the conditions. Her suspicions proved to be well
founded.</p>
<p>After a time the English and Burgundian soldiers came
marching through the gates with their horses and armour, and
their property,&ndash;&ndash;property which proved to be French prisoners.
There they walked, a band of men previously taken, each
one representing so much money in ransom. The poor fellows
cast appealing, piteous glances at their victorious fellow countrymen
as they passed. Jeanne uttered an exclamation, and
stopped the march.</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;they shall not have them.&#8221;</p>
<p>But some of the captains explained to her that under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
terms of the capitulation the prisoners were property, and the
soldiers were justified in taking them away, though it had not
occurred to the King or his Councillors that any such thing
would happen when the terms were given. But the Maid
would not hear of letting the Frenchmen be carried away.</p>
<p>&#8220;They shall not have them,&#8221; she said again. &#8220;The thing
would be monstrous. I will see the Dauphin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which she did at once, and to such good purpose that the
monarch was obliged to ransom the men from their captors,
paying for each one a reasonable sum. French prisoners had
been too plentiful in the wars to be worth much.</p>
<p>Troyes was full of doubt, terror and ill-will toward the Maid,
and Jeanne felt it plainly when she entered the town to prepare
for the reception of the King. At Orl&eacute;ans, at Blois, at Tours,
at Gien, at all other places where she had been the people
thronged about her with enthusiasm. Here they regarded her
as a sorceress, and sent a certain Friar Richard to confront
her. Friar Richard was a Franciscan who had created a great
stir in Paris and Champagne by preaching fervid, emotional
sermons, warning people of the coming of Anti-Christ, and
urging them to forsake their sins, and to prepare for eternity.
As he drew near to the Maid, he crossed himself devoutly, making
the sign of the cross in the air, and sprinkling holy water
before him to exorcise the evil spirit in the girl. Brother
Richard was devout, but he wasn&#8217;t going to run any risk.
Jeanne laughed gayly. She had become accustomed to being
thought possessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on boldly,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I shall not fly away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon this the good man fell upon his knees before her, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
the Maid, to show that she was no holier than he, knelt also.
They had some conversation together, and thereafter the friar
was one of her most devoted adherents.</p>
<p>The day after the surrender Charles entered the city in
splendor, and went at once to the cathedral, where he received
the oaths of loyalty of the burghers. The day following the
troops marched on to Ch&acirc;lons, but met with no resistance. All
opposition to the King&#8217;s advance had collapsed, and eagerly the
towns opened their gates to him. After all, he was French,
and it was natural for Frenchmen to turn to their rightful King
and believe in him in spite of the English. And so with ever
increasing army Charles marched in triumph towards Reims.</p>
<p>Ch&acirc;lons, Troyes, and other places that had made submission
wrote to Reims immediately advising that town to do likewise
as Charles was a &#8220;sweet, gracious, pitiful and compassionate
prince, of noble demeanor and high understanding, and had
shown clearly and prudently the reasons for which he had
come to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reims laughed the messages to scorn, and vowed to resist
to the death. They had recalled the captain of their garrison,
who was at Ch&acirc;teau-Thierry, but they limited his escort to fifty
horsemen, for which reason the captain very properly declined
to come, saying that he could not attempt to hold the city with
fewer than three hundred men. So when Charles reached
Sept-Saulx, a fortress within four leagues of Reims, it sent out
representatives to him to offer its full and entire obedience, in
token of which the envoys presented the King with the keys of
the city.</p>
<p>It was finished. The march to Reims, which has been called
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
&#8220;The Bloodless March,&#8221; was ended. The wonderful and victorious
campaign with all its lists of towns taken had lasted but
six weeks, almost every day of which was distinguished by some
victory. The King and his Councillors had been fearful of
the result, but the Maid had carried them through in triumph.
Every promise which she had made had been fulfilled. There
was nothing now between Charles, the discredited Dauphin of
three months agone, and the sacred ceremonial which drew
with it every &#8220;tradition and assurance of an ancient and lawful
throne.&#8221; Some time later when the Regent wished to make the
same march with young Henry of England to crown him at
Reims the Duke of Burgundy advised against the attempt,
stating that it was too difficult and perilous to imitate.</p>
<p>On the morning of Saturday, July sixteenth, the Archbishop,
Regnault de Chartres, who had been kept out of his city by the
Burgundians, entered it to make preparations to receive his
royal master. In the afternoon the King, with Jeanne riding
by his side, his Councillors, the princes and nobles, the captains,
and a great train of soldiers, and citizens of neighboring places
entered in state. The streets were thronged with people who
cheered lustily at sight of the monarch, crying &#8220;<ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''N&ouml;el! N&ouml;el!'' in original text">No&euml;l! No&euml;l!</ins>&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0014' id='FNanchor_0014'></a><a href='#Footnote_0014' class='fnanchor'>[14]</a>
but who struggled and shouldered each other in the natural
curiosity to catch glimpses of the wonderful Maid with her
shining armour and fair sweet face.</p>
<p>The King, the Maid, and the heads of the expedition were to
be lodged in the palace of the Archbishop, which was near the
great cathedral, but as the procession made its way thither
Jeanne uttered a cry of joy; for, gazing at her half fearfully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
from the crowd were her father, Jacques D&#8217;Arc, and her uncle,
Durand Lassois. The King turned to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, ma mie?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father, my dear father, is standing there among the
people,&#8221; she cried, waving her hand at the two rustics. &#8220;And
with him stands my uncle, Durand Lassois: he who took me to
Vaucouleurs, you remember?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember, Jeanne. We must see and speak with them
both,&#8221; said the monarch graciously. &#8220;Bring them to us later.&#8221;</p>
<p>With another wave of her hand at the two the maiden
passed on. In the evening Charles was led to a platform which
had been erected before the cathedral, and there, amid the red
glare of bonfires, flaming torches, the ringing of bells and the
acclaiming shouts of the assembled people he was shown to the
multitude by the peers of France, with the traditional proclamation:<a name='FNanchor_0015' id='FNanchor_0015'></a><a href='#Footnote_0015' class='fnanchor'>[15]</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Here is your King whom we, peers of France, crown as
King and Sovereign Lord. And if there is a soul here who has
any objection to make, let him speak and we will answer him.
And to-morrow he shall be consecrated by the grace of the Holy
Spirit if you have nothing to say against it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the people shouted, &#8220;<ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''N&ouml;el! N&ouml;el! N&ouml;el!'' in original text">No&euml;l! No&euml;l! No&euml;l!</ins>&#8221; in a frenzy
of delight, and so this preliminary ceremony was concluded.
There was feasting in the palace of the Archbishop that night.
But Jeanne slipped away from it all and made her way quickly
to the little inn called The Zebra, in front of the cathedral,
which was kept by Alice Moreau, a widow, where she would
find her father and uncle. To her delight her brothers had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
come hither also, and when Jeanne entered Jacques was standing
with an arm around each, his usually undemonstrative face
beaming with gladness, for they had been telling him of Jeanne
and her exploits. He started toward her as she came through
the door, then stopped suddenly and stood gazing at her with
doubt and hesitation, but Jeanne flung herself upon him with
the abandonment of a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Dear, dear father! I did not hope
for this. Oh! how glad I am to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jacques could not utter a word for a moment, but held her
close, close as though he would never let her go. When at
last he spoke it was with choked and trembling accents.</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you forgive me, my little one? All the harshness
and severity that I showed you? My child, I did not know,
I did not understand&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne smiled at him through her tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could you understand, father? I did not either for a
long time. But it is over now. My mission will be ended to-morrow
when the Dauphin is crowned. And then I am going
back home with you to mother. Dear mother! how is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Jeanne; but longs for you always.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I for her,&#8221; said Jeanne, tearfully. &#8220;I shall never
leave you again, father. I shall be glad to get back.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this Durand interposed:</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be contented there, Jeanne. Just think how set
you were to get away. And now you have done everything
you wanted to do. And it was I that helped you to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Uncle Durand; and the King wishes to see you to
thank you for it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The King?&#8221; exclaimed Lassois, almost dumbfounded by
this news. &#8220;Why, Jeanne, you don&#8217;t mean that he wants to
see me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; said Jeanne, laughing. &#8220;He says that by helping
me to go to Messire Robert you have done more for the
country than any other man in France.&#8221;</p>
<p>Durand could scarcely contain himself at this, and beamed
delightedly. Presently he said, wistfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you ever get afraid in battle, Jeanne? I heard that
you were wounded once. I should think that you would be so
afraid that you&#8217;d run away as soon as the guns began to shoot
and the arrows to fly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not fear wounds or battle,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;I fear only&ndash;&ndash;treachery;&#8221;
and a shadow crossed her face.</p>
<p>It was a happy family party there at the little inn. There
was wonder and admiration in the regard which the simple
peasants bestowed upon the maiden, but there was love also,
and the weary girl, longing for home and rest since her mission
was so nearly completed, gave herself up to its blessed consolation.
Far into the night she talked, and then she left them;
for the morrow would bring the coronation, and there was much
to be done.</p>
<p>It was the tradition that coronations should take place on
Sunday, so that there was little sleep in Reims that night.
Everything had to be prepared; decorations for the cathedral
and town, and provisions for the ceremonial. Many of the
necessary articles were at Saint Denis, in the hands of the
English, and the treasury of the cathedral had to be ransacked
to find fitting vessels. All night the work of preparation went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
on. And all night long rejoicing crowds filled the streets and
the great square before the cathedral, where the Dauphin kept
vigil, as was the custom of the Sovereign the night before
his coronation.</p>
<p>At dawn of day the town began to fill with visitors, great
personages and small ones, to attend the rites, and to render
homage. All France seemed to pour into the place; for the
people were to have their rightful king, and French hearts were
joyful. It mattered not after this who should be crowned&ndash;&ndash;Henry
of England, or another&ndash;&ndash;there would be but one King
of France, Charles the Seventh, he who was anointed with the
sacred oil in the city of Reims, where all kings of France had
been crowned since the time of Clovis. Charles had been
crowned after a fashion at Bourges, but in the eyes of the nation
he was not King until the oil from the mystic ampoule
brought down from Heaven by a dove to Saint Remi was
poured upon his brow. Jeanne, a daughter of the people, understood
this better than the politicians who tried to thwart her
design of leading Charles to his sacring, deeming it a piece of
childish folly. After the crowning, when the increased prestige
and loyalty which it brought to Charles was seen, its significance
was understood not only by the politicians but by the
Regent Bedford. It was a decided advantage which this girl
of the people gained over the English claimant by her quickness
in taking the Dauphin to be crowned.</p>
<p>The ceremonies were to begin at nine o&#8217;clock, Sunday morning,
July the seventeenth, and long before that hour the ancient
cathedral was filled to overflowing with nobles and men-at-arms,
and dignitaries both civic and ecclesiastic, richly and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
gayly attired in gorgeous stuffs: cloth of gold, cloth of silver,
brocades of crimson and azure, and silks dyed in all the colors
of the rainbow, mingled with sheen of glittering spears and
shining armour: a brilliant gathering. Charles the Dauphin
waited at the foot of the high altar, garbed in a robe of cerulean
blue over which was scattered the golden fleur-de-lis. Outside
the cathedral the streets were thronged with people in
holiday attire, wearing leaden medals which bore an effigy of
Jeanne. After the coronation the King too had thirteen gold
medals struck in honour of the Maid, which bore her device, a
hand holding a sword, and the inscription, Consilio firmata Dei.
(Strong in the Counsel of God.) These and a vase of silver
were among the gifts which he bestowed on the Chapter of
Reims.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a blare of trumpets, and from the palace
of the Archbishop there issued a wonderful procession. Four
peers of France,&ndash;&ndash;the Mar&eacute;chal de Boussac, Gravile, de Rais,
Admiral de Culent,&ndash;&ndash;armed and accoutred, and a great company
with banners floating rode through the streets to the old
Abbey of St. Remi&ndash;&ndash;which had been consecrated in the eleventh
century&ndash;&ndash;to bring from its shrine, where it was strictly guarded
by the monks, the Sainte Ampoule, the holy and sacred vial
which held the oil sent from Heaven for the sacring of Clovis.
The noble messengers were the hostages of this sacred charge,
and kneeling they bound themselves by an oath never to lose
sight of it by day or night, till it was restored to its appointed
guardians.</p>
<p>This vow having been taken, the Abbot of St. Remi, in his
richest robes, appeared surrounded by his monks, carrying the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
treasure in his hands; and under a splendid canopy, blazing in
the sunshine with cloth of gold, marched toward the cathedral
under escort of the noble hostages. Into the cathedral rode the
cavalcade through the great west door. Their coming was
proclaimed by chimes of bells, and blare of trumpets, and
chanting of hymns until a mighty volume of sound rolled and
swelled through the vaulted domes of the ancient building.
Straight up to the entrance of the choir they rode, and there the
Abbot gave over the sacred Chrism to the Archbishop. Then
began the long and imposing ceremonies of the coronation.
There were prayers, and anthems, and sermons, but at length
the king-at-arms, standing upon the steps of the altar, called
upon the twelve peers of France to come and serve their King.</p>
<p>There were vacant places to be supplied, both among the temporal
and the spiritual peers, but Alen&ccedil;on, Clermont, Vend&ocirc;me,
Guy de Laval, La Tr&eacute;mouille and Maill&eacute; filled them.
Among the clerical peers the Archbishop of Reims, the Bishops
of Ch&acirc;lons and Laon were present; the others were supplied.
In the absence of Richemont, the Constable of France, d&#8217;Albret
held the Sword of State. D&#8217;Alen&ccedil;on, in place of &#8220;false Burgundy,&#8221;
dubbed Charles a knight; then the Archbishop raised
the holy flask and anointed the Dauphin upon the brow, upon
his shoulders, within the joints of his arms and the palms of his
hands, slits being cut and embroidered in his robe to this use.
All was done according to ancient custom, the Dauphin kneeling
the while. Administering the oath the Archbishop then
took the crown and held it high above the monarch&#8217;s head; the
twelve peers of the realm, closing in, held it firm; then gently it
was lowered upon the brows of the kneeling prince.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Arise, Charles, King of France,&#8221; cried the prelate in a loud
voice. And, as Charles was lifted high in the throne chair by
the peers that all might see, he cried again: &#8220;Behold your
King!&#8221;</p>
<p>As Charles the Seventh, King of France, faced his people a
mighty shout of &#8220;<ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''N&ouml;el! N&ouml;el! N&ouml;el!'' in original text">No&euml;l! No&euml;l! No&euml;l!</ins>&#8221; came from the assembly,
while crash of chimes, chanting voices, and music of instruments
rolled through the arches, until the vaulted heights
answered again and again.</p>
<p>Throughout the ceremony, close to Charles upon the steps of
the altar stood Jeanne with her standard in her hand. &#8220;It had
borne the burden, it should share the glory,&#8221; she said afterwards.
&#8220;And a right fair thing it was to see the goodly manners
of the King and the Maid. She who was in truth the
cause of the crowning of the King and of all the assembly.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0016' id='FNanchor_0016'></a><a href='#Footnote_0016' class='fnanchor'>[16]</a></p>
<p>Pale with emotion Jeanne had stood watching every step of
the ceremonial with intentness. When at last it was ended she
could control herself no longer. Stepping forward she fell at
the feet of the newly crowned monarch, embracing his knees,
and weeping for joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentle King, now is the pleasure of God fulfilled&ndash;&ndash;whose
will it was that I should raise the siege of <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''Orleans'' in original text">Orl&eacute;ans</ins>, and lead
you to this city of Reims to receive your consecration. Now
has He shown that you are the true King, and that the kingdom
of France belongs to you alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soft, and low, and broken came the words. They pierced
all hearts, and &#8220;right great pity came upon all those who saw
her, and many wept.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0017' id='FNanchor_0017'></a><a href='#Footnote_0017' class='fnanchor'>[17]</a></p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></div>
<p>Many wept. The girl was so young, so fair, so slight, yet
what great deeds had she not wrought? In three months she
had given France a king, and to the King, a country. In spite
of obstacles that would seem incredible were they not a part of
recorded history she had accomplished her mission. A great
soul in which intense zeal was wedded to intense purpose had
wrought marvels, and changed the destiny of a nation.</p>
<p>Many wept, and the King too was moved. Perhaps at that
moment he felt more gratitude towards the maiden than ever
before or afterward. Lifting her, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You have brought us to our crowning, beloved Maid.
Speak, and whatsoever grace you ask it shall be granted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Jeanne fell upon her knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most noble King, out of your grace I beseech you to grant
that the taxes of my village be remitted. Its people are poor,
and it brings great hardship upon them to pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all, Jeanne?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Sire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then in consideration of the great, high, notable, and profitable
service which this, our beloved Jeanne the Maid, has rendered
and daily renders us in the recovery of our Kingdom, in
her favour and at her request, we therefore decree that Domremy,
the native village of Jeanne D&#8217;Arc, Deliverer of France,
be forever exempt from taxation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the people shouted fervently. They recognized the
justice of the grant, and wondered only that she asked so little.</p>
<p>&#8220;<ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''N&ouml;el! N&ouml;el! N&ouml;el!'' in original text">No&euml;l! No&euml;l! No&euml;l!</ins>&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0018' id='FNanchor_0018'></a><a href='#Footnote_0018' class='fnanchor'>[18]</a></p>
<p>For centuries the privilege lasted, and against the names of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
Domremy and Greux, its adjoining village, in the tax gatherer&#8217;s
book was written:</p>
<p>&#8220;Domremy ... <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''Rein-La'' in original text">Rien-La</ins> Pucelle,&#8221; &#8220;Nothing&ndash;&ndash;For the
sake of the Maid.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had gained a kingdom, yet all she asked in return was
that the taxes of her poor oppressed village might be remitted.
She wished for nothing for herself. Not the least of the girl&#8217;s
great qualities was her unselfishness.</p>

<p>There was feasting in Reims after the coronation. In
the Archbishop&#8217;s palace the King was served with the
princes of the blood and the nobles. The tables
stretched to the streets that the people might be served also; all
Reims ate, drank, and made merry. But Jeanne, always exceedingly
temperate in the matter of eating and drinking, soon
slipped away from the festivities. She had other work on
hand.</p>
<p>There was a letter to be written to the Duke of Burgundy,
the greatest peer of France. Philip, because of the blood feud
between him and Charles, had cast his power and influence with
Regent Bedford against his own countrymen. Jeanne had
written to him before in June at the beginning of the march to
Reims, summoning him to the crowning of the King, but had
heard from neither letter nor herald. It was the maiden&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
belief that all Frenchmen should unite against the common
enemy, laying aside private griefs that France might be served.
She had no party feeling, and was possessed of a fund of common
sense which made her see what a powerful ally Philip of
Burgundy would be. So now she wrote again, summoning him
to renounce his feud with his cousin, the King, and thus to heal
the breach which had divided the realm into two great parties.</p>
<div style="font-size:95%; margin:3% 5%">
<p class='center'>&#8220;JHESUS MARIA</p>
<p>&#8220;High and redoubtable Prince, Duke of Burgundy.
Jeanne the Maid requires on the part of the King of Heaven,
my most just sovereign and Lord, that the King of France and
you make peace between yourselves, firm, strong, and that will
endure. Pardon each other of good heart, entirely, as loyal
Christians ought to do, and if you desire to fight let it be against
the Saracens. Prince of Burgundy, I pray, supplicate, and
require as humbly as may be, that you fight no longer against
the holy kingdom of France: withdraw, at once and speedily,
your people who are in any strongholds or fortresses of the
said holy kingdom; and on the part of the gentle King of
France, he is ready to make peace with you, having respect to
his honor. All those who war against the said holy kingdom
of France, war against King Jesus, King of Heaven, and of all
the world and my just and sovereign Lord. And I pray and
require with clasped hands that you fight not, nor make
any battle against us, neither your friends nor your subjects.
For however great in numbers may be the men you
lead against us, you will never win, and it would be great pity
for the battle and the blood that would be shed of those who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
came against us. Three weeks ago I sent you a letter by a
herald that you should be present at the consecration of the
King, which to-day, Sunday, the seventeenth of the present
month of July, is done in the city of Reims: to which I have
had no answer. To God I commend you, and may He be your
guard if it pleases Him, and I pray God to make good peace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Written at the aforesaid Reims, the seventeenth day of
July, 1429.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Jeanne the Maid.</span>&#8221;<span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<p>So, her mission ended, the girl began to make preparations
for her return home with her father. When she left Vaucouleurs
she had taken with her the red homespun dress that she
had worn from home, and had always kept it with her. She
brought it forth, and smoothed its folds tenderly.</p>
<p>It was of coarse fabric unlike the brocades and satins of the
knight&#8217;s suits that she now wore, but Jeanne&#8217;s eyes grew misty,
and soft, and wistful as she fondled it; the simple frock meant
home and mother to her. Presently the members of the Household
began to come in to take farewell, for all knew that she
felt that her task was finished and that it was her intention to
return to Domremy. But it was not to be.</p>
<p>The next day Jeanne sought Charles and asked him of his
graciousness to let her depart. Her mission was closed, she
told him. She had done the two things that she was charged
to do: the siege of Orl&eacute;ans was raised, and she had led him to his
crowning. She wished now to go back home with her father,
and of his goodness she begged him to let her depart.</p>
<p>The monarch heard her with surprise.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Go back now, Jeanne?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;That cannot be.
We need you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay, gentle King. There is no further need of me. You
are crowned, and the towns will receive you joyfully. Whatever
of fighting there is to be done the men-at-arms can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Maid, have you forgot Paris? We are to march there
from here, and who can lead the men-at-arms to the storming
so well as you? You will inspire them, give them heart and
courage, and frighten the enemy. We cannot do without you
yet, Jeanne. We need you; the country needs you. Stay
your departure for yet a little while we entreat&ndash;&ndash;nay; we command
it, Jeanne.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her King and her country needed her. That was enough
for the girl whose every heart beat was for France. So sorrowfully
she wended her way to The Zebra, the little inn where
Jacques and Durand were stopping.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; she said sadly, as Jacques came forward to meet
her, &#8220;I can not go home. I must continue with the army.
It is the King&#8217;s command.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not go back, my little one?&#8221; exclaimed her father, his face
clouding. &#8220;Why, Isabeau will be sore disappointed. She
thought you would come after your work was done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I too, father, but the noble King commands me to stay.
He hath need of me, he says. And France needs me.&#8221; And,
as she had done when she was a little child, Jeanne laid her head
on her father&#8217;s shoulder and cried like the homesick girl that
she was. Her father comforted her tenderly. His own disappointment
was great.</p>
<p>&#8220;We went to see the King, Jeanne,&#8221; spoke Durand suddenly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He had us brought to him, and he was graciousness itself.
I wonder not that you delight to serve him; so sweet and pitiful
he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he is,&#8221; exclaimed the maiden. &#8220;For know, father, that
he has exempted both Domremy and Greux from the taxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that is good,&#8221; cried Jacques delightedly. &#8220;That will
be news indeed to carry back!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we each have a horse,&#8221; Durand told her proudly.
&#8220;And we are to have our keep for so long as we wish to stay
in Reims. The town will have it so. And all because we are
of kin to Jeanne D&#8217;Arc.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne smiled at his pleasure. She too had gifts which she
had bought to carry home herself. Now she gave them to
her father to deliver with many a loving message, and then took
a lingering farewell of them. Her heart was very full as she
returned to the palace of the Archbishop, and once more took
up her position as a general in the royal army. She never saw
either her father or her uncle again.</p>
<p>Jeanne supposed that it was the King&#8217;s intention to march
directly upon Paris the day after the coronation. To the
surprise of every one Charles dallied at Reims for four days,
and did not set forth from the town until the twenty-first of
July. Then with banners flying the royal army rode from
the gates with glad hearts and high hopes, Jeanne with her
standard riding in front of the King. With the Maid leading
them the troops believed themselves to be invincible. They
were filled with confidence, for Paris once taken, the power
of the English in northern France would be entirely broken.
Both Burgundy and Bedford realized this fact to the full.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
&#8220;Paris is the heart of the mystic body of the kingdom,&#8221; wrote
the former to the Regent in the Spring of 1430. &#8220;Only by
liberating the heart can the body be made to flourish.&#8221; What
was true in 1430 was equally so in 1429. The right policy,
therefore, was to advance at once and storm Paris.</p>
<p>But the King stopped at the Abbey of Saint Marcoul and
&#8220;touched for the King&#8217;s Evil.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0019' id='FNanchor_0019'></a><a href='#Footnote_0019' class='fnanchor'>[19]</a> Nothing should have been
allowed to waste time. It should have been Paris first, and
then Saint Marcoul; for Bedford at this very time was marching
from Calais with newly landed troops under Cardinal
Beaufort.</p>
<p>After Saint Marcoul Charles marched next to Vailly, and
having received the keys of Soissons passed to that city.
Everywhere he was received with acclamations, town after
town yielding to him and the Maid. The army was now only
sixty miles from Paris. Bedford had not reached the city,
which had but a small garrison, and many of its citizens favored
Charles. Only a vigorous advance was required to take it,
and so end the war. At Soissons the King received the submission
of many towns, but there was nothing else done.
When the army set forth again the King turned about and
headed due south for Ch&acirc;teau-Thierry; after two days he proceeded
to Provins, which was reached on August second.</p>
<p>This place was about sixty miles south of Soissons, and fifty
miles southeast of Paris. With all his marching after ten
days Charles was but ten miles nearer his objective point.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of the troops was dwindling. Jeanne and
the captains viewed the effects of the vacillating manoeuvring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
of the King with despair; for no one seemed to know what
it all meant. The Maid at length sought Charles for an explanation.
To her surprise she learned that ambassadors from
Burgundy had come to Reims on the very day of the coronation,
desiring a truce between the King and the Duke. The envoys
had marched with them since then, for the belief was so strong
that Paris should be taken that the King and his Councillors
did not dare treat with them while feeling ran so high. Now,
however, the envoys had succeeded in establishing a sort of
truce by the terms of which Burgundy was to deliver up Paris
to Charles at the end of a fortnight.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of a fortnight,&#8221; repeated Jeanne in dismay.
&#8220;In God&#8217;s name, gentle King, the regent will have time to
bring his new troops into the town before the two weeks are
sped. All the Duke of Burgundy wants is to gain time for
the English regent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to reflect upon the honor of our cousin Burgundy?&#8221;
demanded Charles haughtily. &#8220;His intentions toward
us are most kind, we assure you, Jeanne. It is our dearest
wish to be at peace with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make peace, Sire; but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what, dear Maid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make it at the point of the lance,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;None other
will be so lasting. A quick advance, Sire, and Paris is ours,
and with it all France.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it not be best to take it without bloodshed?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;By your way much Christian blood must perforce be
spilled. By this truce with our cousin the city will be ours
peaceably. Is not that best?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It may be,&#8221; she agreed sorrowfully.</p>
<p>There was no more to be said, so with heavy heart she went
from the presence to report to the captains. Silently they
heard her; for none of them believed that Philip of Burgundy
would ever deliver Paris to the King. So &#8220;turning first the
flanks, then the rear of his army towards Paris, dragging with
him the despairing Maid, the King headed for the Loire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond that river lay pleasure and amusement; time could
be taken for ease and enjoyment, and the unworthy King desired
them more than honor. In this he was encouraged by
La Tr&eacute;mouille and his party.</p>
<p>Reims, Soissons and other cities that had made submission
were alarmed because the King was abandoning them to the
mercy of Burgundy, and the men of Reims wrote to Jeanne
telling her their fears. To which she made answer:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear good friends, good and loyal Frenchmen, the Maid
sends you news of her.... Never will I abandon you while
I live. True it is that the King has made a fifteen days&#8217; truce
with the Duke of Burgundy, who is to give up to him the town
of Paris peacefully on the fifteenth day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although the truce is made, I am not content, and am not
certain that I will keep it. If I do it will be merely for the sake
of the King&#8217;s honor, and in case they do not deceive the blood
royal, for I will keep the King&#8217;s army together and in readiness,
at the end of the fifteen days, if peace is not made.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Bray, where Charles expected to cross the Seine on his
road to the Loire, he found a strong Anglo-Burgundian force
in possession, so facing about he started toward Paris. Jeanne
and the captains rejoiced openly, for they had no desire to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
cross the river, but wished only to keep near the capital until
the truce was ended.</p>
<p>The erratic marching and indecision of the royal Council
and the King were ruining the spirit of the men-at-arms; but
the country people who knew naught of the parleying with
Burgundy were wild with delight at the coming of Charles,
and crowded to gaze upon him as he passed by. Jeanne was
touched by their demonstrations of delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is a good people,&#8221; she remarked one day, as she rode
between Dunois and the Archbishop of Reims when the army
was near Cr&eacute;py. &#8220;Never have I seen any so glad of the coming
of the noble King. I would that when I die I were so
happy as to be buried in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne, in what place do you expect to die?&#8221; asked the
Archbishop, who had never been a friend of Jeanne&#8217;s, and
wished to draw some expression of prophecy from her that
might be used against her.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it shall please God,&#8221; she made answer; &#8220;for I know
no more of the time and place than you do. Would that it
pleased God my Creator to let me depart at this time, and
lay down my arms, and go to serve my father and mother in
keeping their sheep with my brothers, for they would be very
glad to see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a note of sadness in the words. Even Jeanne&#8217;s
brave spirit was feeling the strain of the fluctuating, futile
marchings.</p>
<p>On August eleventh Charles lay at Cr&eacute;py-en-Valois, where
he received a letter from Bedford, who by this time had brought
his troops near to Paris and now lay between that city and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
the French army. It was a brutally insulting letter, obviously
written for the purpose of forcing the monarch to fight in the
open field. It closed by challenging him to single combat,
and with an appeal to the Almighty. Any man with an ounce
of red blood in his veins would have accepted the challenge, and
died gloriously, if needs be, in defense of his honor. Charles
merely ignored the letter. It is said of him that at a later
date he discovered great valour, taking the field in person
against his enemies, and fighting in knightly fashion. It seems
a pity that such gallantry was not in evidence at this period.</p>
<p>On August fourteenth the armies of Charles and Bedford
came face to face at Mont&eacute;pilloy. It was near evening, and
after a skirmish they both encamped for the night.</p>
<p>In the morning the royal army found Bedford entrenched
in a strong position. His flanks and front were carefully protected
by earthworks and a stockade made of stout stakes
carried by English archers for the purpose. Thrust deep into
the ground, they would break the charge of cavalry, and were
very formidable. In the rear was a lake and a stream, so that
no attack could be made from that quarter. Over the host
floated the banners of France and England.</p>
<p>The French army formed in four divisions: the advance-guard,
commanded by Alen&ccedil;on; the centre, commanded by
Ren&eacute; de Bar; the rear, with which were the King himself and
La <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''Tr&eacute;mou&iuml;lle'' in original text">Tr&eacute;mouille</ins>, was under Charles de Bourbon, and a large
body of skirmishers under Jeanne, Dunois and La Hire.</p>
<p>The position of Bedford was too strong to admit of a
direct attack. He also had the advantage of a superiority in
numbers, so the French tried to draw his forces from behind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
their barricades in the same manner that Talbot had tried to
entice Jeanne to forsake the strong position which she had
occupied on the height above Beaugency the night before Patay.
But, though several times French knights, both on foot and
on horseback, rode up to the palisade and so taunted the English
that some of them rushed out, the result was only skirmishing.
The main body of the enemy stood firm.</p>
<p>When Jeanne saw that they would not come out she rode,
standard in hand, up to the palisade and struck it a ringing
blow hoping to excite the enemy into action. For answer
the English called, &#8220;Witch! Milkmaid! Go home to your
cows. If we catch you we&#8217;ll burn you.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were other names added, some of them vile and insulting.
At the same time they waved in mocking defiance a
standard copied from that of Jeanne&#8217;s, showing a distaff and
spindle, and bearing the motto: &#8220;Let the fair Maid come.
We&#8217;ll give her wool to spin.&#8221;</p>
<p>This roused the rage of the French, and thereafter no quarter
was asked or given in the skirmishes that ensued when parties
of the English sallied out in answer to the jibes and taunts of
the French. But with all their endeavors the English were not
to be stung into leaving their strong position. Later Alen&ccedil;on
and the Maid sent a message that they would retire and give
the English a fair field to deploy in, but they did not accept
the offer. Bedford was not anxious for a chivalrous engagement
in a fair field.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the English captured a few field pieces
which the French had brought up to enfilade the English line.
So the long summer day passed, and when it grew dusk so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
that friend and foe could not be distinguished from each other
the French retired to their quarters. The King left them,
and retired to Cr&eacute;py.</p>
<p>Early the next morning the French withdrew, hoping that
the English would follow them. But the Regent would not.
As soon as he was clear of the French he retreated to Senlis
and from there went to Paris. Of course the royal army should
have followed him, but the triumphant spirit that filled the
troops at Patay had been dissipated. The captains feared to
move without the King&#8217;s sanction, and, though Jeanne counselled
the pursuit, they deemed it best to join the King at
Cr&eacute;py.</p>
<p>Compi&egrave;gne, Senlis, and Beauvais now made their submission
to the King and the Maid. Charles marched at once to
Compi&egrave;gne, fifty miles from Paris. At Beauvais those persons
who refused to recognize Charles were driven out with
their possessions. Among these was Pierre Cauchon, its
Bishop. This man never forgave Jeanne for being the cause
of his losing his diocese and his revenues, and later took a dire
revenge upon her.</p>
<p>Charles dallied at Compi&egrave;gne, greatly to the distress of
Jeanne, who knew the value of rapid movements. She saw
too that the troops were losing heart. The King, however, was
busy entangling himself with new truces with Burgundy, but
of this the Maid at this time knew naught. She only knew
that the fifteen days&#8217; truce was ended, and Paris had not been
delivered to her King; that August was almost spent, and that
nothing had been accomplished. She grieved at the monarch&#8217;s
shilly-shallying, and suspected that he was content with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
grace God had given him without undertaking any further enterprise.</p>
<p>As the time passed without bringing action of any sort, or
any promise of it, the girl&#8217;s patience became thoroughly exhausted.
She had only a year to work in, she had said, and
France&#8217;s King was wasting the time that should have been
used for France. So one day she said to Alen&ccedil;on:</p>
<p>&#8220;My fair duke, make ready the men, for by my staff, I wish
to see Paris nearer than I have seen it yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words struck a responsive chord in Alen&ccedil;on&#8217;s breast,
and the captains gladly made ready for the march; for all were
weary of inaction, and discouraged by the irresolution of the
King.</p>
<p>On the twenty-third of August, therefore, the troops under
Jeanne and Alen&ccedil;on set forth, making a short pause at Senlis
so that the forces under the Count de Vend&ocirc;me might join
them. It was hoped that, moved by their example, the King
would be impelled to follow them with the main body of the
army; the hope proved a futile one. After three days&#8217; march
they rode into St. Denys, a town six miles from Paris, and the
other sacred place of the realm.</p>
<p>It was the city of the Martyr Saint whose name was the
war cry of France. It was also the city of the tomb; for, as
Reims was the place where French kings were crowned, so St.
Denys was the town where French kings were buried. From
antiquity they had lain here in the great Abbey, where too was
the crown of Charlemagne. There were also many sacred
relics of the saints here, among them a head said to be that of
Saint Denys. It was a sacred place to all French hearts.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></div>
<p>At their approach those people who were of Anglo-Burgundian
opinions retired to Paris, terrified by the dark stories of
vengeance with which the emissaries of Burgundy had beguiled
them, so that those who remained in the place were
royalists. As she had often done of late Jeanne became godmother
for two little babies, holding them at the font. When
the little ones were boys she gave them the name of the King;
if they were girls, and the parents had no name for them, she
called them Jeanne.</p>
<p>There was further vexatious delay here in waiting for the
coming of the King. It was a supreme moment in the affairs
of the realm. All that had been gained in the summer was now
to be either entirely lost, or fully perfected by this attack on
the capital. Charles&#8217;s presence was needed for the authority
and approval that it gave, and, too, the main body of the
army was necessary for the attack as the city was too strong
to be assailed with what troops Alen&ccedil;on and Jeanne had with
them. Courier after courier was sent to the King to urge his
coming, and at length Alen&ccedil;on rode back to entreat his presence.
Reluctantly the monarch advanced to Senlis, and there
stopped. &#8220;It seemed that he was advised against the Maid
and the Duc d&#8217;Alen&ccedil;on and their company.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0020' id='FNanchor_0020'></a><a href='#Footnote_0020' class='fnanchor'>[20]</a></p>
<p>Meantime Jeanne employed the time in skirmishing and
reconnoissances, studying the city to find the best point for the
onslaught. Alen&ccedil;on also sent letters to the burghers, calling
the dignitaries by name, and asking them to surrender to their
true Lord.</p>
<p>The authorities in the city were not idle. They strengthened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
the fortifications, and frightened the people by spreading stories
of the dire vengeance that Charles had sworn to wreak against
them. He would deliver the city and its people of all ages
and conditions to the pleasure of his soldiers, it was said; and
he had also sworn to raze it to its foundations so that the plough
should break the ground where Paris had stood. Terrified by
these tales the citizens feared to leave the gates to gather the
grapes which grew on the slopes beyond the walls, or to get
the vegetables from the great gardens which lay to the north
of the city.</p>
<p>Finally, after a fortnight, Charles arrived at Saint Denys,
and his coming was hailed with delight. The army was
wrought up to a high pitch of excitement, and was eager for
assault. &#8220;There was no one of whatever condition who did not
say, &#8216;The Maid will lead the King into Paris if he will let
her.&#8217;&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0021' id='FNanchor_0021'></a><a href='#Footnote_0021' class='fnanchor'>[21]</a> Charles himself was not so eager. In truth, the last
thing in the world that he desired was this attack.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the day of his arrival Jeanne and the
captains started toward the city walls to make the usual demonstration.
The King rode with them.</p>
<p>Now at Blois, at Orl&eacute;ans, on the march to Reims the army of
men was orderly, clean confessed and of holy life; but it was
no longer what it had been. It is idleness that demoralizes and
disorganizes men on the march or in camp. Action keeps them
in trim, and in a righteous way of living. The personnel of the
troops was no longer what it had been before Orl&eacute;ans. After
the coronation men had flocked in from every quarter; soldiers
of the robber companies, rude, foul, and disorderly. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
revered the Maid for her saintly manner of life, but continued
to practice their own vices, greatly to her distress.</p>
<p>So now as the King and the Maid rode from the town toward
the walls of the city one of the vile women who followed the
camp thrust herself forward boldly from the crowd of people
who had gathered to watch the passing of the monarch and the
girl, and leered insolently at them. At this, all of Jeanne&#8217;s
youthful purity was roused to a blaze of indignation, and she
brought up her sword quickly, and smote the creature a smart
blow with the flat side of the weapon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get you gone,&#8221; she cried sharply.</p>
<p>Instantly at the touch of the unclean thing the blade parted
in two. One piece fell to the ground, and Jeanne, stricken
by the happening, sat gazing silently at what remained in her
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis the holy sword,&#8221; exclaimed Charles, aghast. &#8220;Are
there no cudgels to be had that you should use the sacred
weapon? I like not the omen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne made no reply. She could not. All about her ran
whispers and outcries as news of the incident flew from lip to
lip. Soon the story was spread through the army. The Maid
had broken the miraculous sword. It was a bad portent, and
men shook their heads, saying that it boded ill for future enterprise.
The King sent the sword to his own armourers to be
mended, &#8220;but they could not do it, nor put the pieces together
again; which is great proof that the sword came to her
divinely.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0022' id='FNanchor_0022'></a><a href='#Footnote_0022' class='fnanchor'>[22]</a></p>
<p>At a Council held later it was determined that an attack on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
Paris should be made the next day, and thereupon the troops
withdrew to La Chapelle, a village midway between St. Denys
and Paris, and encamped there for the night. But the King
remained at St. Denys.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like not the day, gentle duke,&#8221; said Jeanne protestingly
to Alen&ccedil;on. &#8220;To-morrow is the Feast of the Nativity of the
Blessed Mother of God. It is not meet to fight on such a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must, Jeanne. We have been insistent that the assault
should be made; and if we decline now La <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''Tr&eacute;mou&iuml;lle'' in original text">Tr&eacute;mouille</ins>
will persuade the King that we are the cause of the delay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; agreed the maiden. &#8220;Well, we will make the attack,
fair duke. After all, it is the duty of Frenchmen to fight
the enemy whenever need arises, be the day what it may.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet in spite of her words it was with reluctance that Jeanne
prepared for the assault the next morning. It was the eighth
of September, upon which day fell the Nativity of the Blessed
Virgin, a great festival of the church. The church bells of La
Chapelle were ringing as she rose, and faintly the bells of Paris
and St. Denys tinkled an answer to the summons to the faithful.
All the citizens of Paris would be at church, for no one
would expect an attack upon such a day, and Jeanne would
far rather have spent the time before the altar. She did not
wish the assault, but yielded to Alen&ccedil;on and the captains.</p>
<p>The troops made a late start, it being eight o&#8217;clock before
they marched out of La Chapelle, and wended their way toward
Paris. The morning was bright and beautiful, though
unusually warm for the season. In the sunshine the towers
and battlements of the city gleamed and glistened. It was a
great city; far greater than Orl&eacute;ans, and a prize worth fighting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
for, but the chances of taking it had diminished by the dalliance
of the King.</p>
<p>The morning was entirely consumed in placing the ordnance,
and getting ready for the assault. The point of attack was to
be a place between the gates of St. Honor&eacute; and St. Denys,
which Jeanne was to lead with Rais and Gaucourt, while
Alen&ccedil;on, placing his guns in the swine market near the gate,
stationed his force behind the Windmill Hill which sloped
above the market. This was done to guard the rear from a
possible attack from a sally of the English from the St. Denys
Gate. The main body of the army was posted as a reserve out
of range. The King did not leave St. Denys. Charles was
the only prince in Europe who did not lead his own army in the
field. All was in readiness, when Jeanne learned to her great
surprise that no serious assault was intended. It was to be an
effort to cause tumult and surrender in the city. The Maid
determined to force the fighting to an issue.</p>
<p>At two o&#8217;clock in the afternoon the trumpet sounded the
call, and the roar and rebound of cannon began, the artillery
plying the boulevard or earthwork which protected the Gate of
St. Honor&eacute;. The palisade weakened; presently the pales fell
with a crash, and the earthen wall of the boulevard stood beyond.
With a shout, &#8220;Mont-joie St. Denys!&#8221; the French
rushed forward with scaling ladders, and began the escalade,
their friends backing them by shooting of arbalests from behind
the remnant of the palisade. By sheer impetuosity they carried
the outpost, and poured over the walls pell-mell, driving its
defenders before them back to the fortifications of the gate
itself.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></div>
<p>All at once their furious advance was brought to a sudden
check; for before them lay two wide deep ditches, one dry, the
other full of water, which here guarded the walls of the gate.
The archers and gunners on the ramparts above jeered mockingly
at the halted French, and sent a rain of stones and arrows
down at them, waving their banners, which mingled the leopards
of England with the rampant <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''two tailed '' in original text">two-tailed</ins> lion of Burgundy.</p>
<p>Jeanne was of course at the head of her men, and only for a
moment did she permit them to pause before the set-back.
Calling loudly for faggots and beams to bridge the moat she
descended into the dry fosse, then climbed out again to the
shelving ridge which divided the two trenches. Some of the
men ran for the bundles of wood and bridging material, while
the others followed her to the ridge. Dismay again seized them
as the wide deep moat full to the brim with water stretched
before them. But Jeanne was not daunted. Handing her
standard to a man at her side, she took a lance and tested the
water amid a shower of arrows and stones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surrender,&#8221; she called to the men on the walls. &#8220;Surrender
to the King of France.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Witch! Evil One!&#8221; they shouted in answer.</p>
<p>By this time the soldiers had brought bundles of wood, faggots,
and whatever would help to fill the moat, Jeanne calling
encouragingly to them the while. Presently they were enabled
to struggle across, and the charge began. At this instant, as
had been arranged, a great commotion was heard in the city,
the loyalists running through the streets and shouting: &#8220;All
is lost! The enemy has entered.&#8221; It was hoped that this
would help the King&#8217;s troops without the gates. The people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
in the churches, panic-stricken, rushed to their homes, shutting
their doors behind them, but there was nothing gained. The
garrison kept their heads, and their numbers at the gates and
on the ramparts were increased.</p>
<p>The firing now became very heavy; the artillery bellowed and
the guns roared in answer. There were shouts of men, and
words of order. And through the rattle of guns, the whizzing
rush of stones, the smiting with axe or sword on wooden barrier
and steel harness, the hundreds of war cries there sounded the
wonderful, silvery tones of a girl&#8217;s voice, clear as a clarion call:</p>
<p>&#8220;On! On, friends! They are ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the shelving ridge between the two ditches stood the
Maid, her white armour gleaming in the sunshine, a shining
figure, exposed to every shot and missile. Hour after hour
she stood, in the heat of the fire, shouting directions to her men,
urging, cheering them while always the struggle raged around
her, her banner floating over her head. Suddenly a mighty
shout of joy went up from the men on the walls. Three times
the roar rent the din of battle. For the Witch had fallen,
pierced through the thigh by a bolt from a crossbow.</p>
<p>Undismayed, Jeanne struggled to her feet, when the man
at her side who bore her standard was hit in the foot. Lifting
his visor to pull the arrow from the wound he was struck between
the eyes, and fell dead at the maiden&#8217;s feet. Jeanne
caught the standard as he fell, but for a moment her own
strength failed her, and she sank beside the standard bearer.
When her men would have borne her out of the battle she would
not consent, but rallied them to the charge. Then slowly, painfully,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
she crept behind a heap of stones, and soon the dauntless
voice rang out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends! Friends! be of good cheer. On! On!&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, wounded, weak, unable to stand she lay, urging
the soldiers on, and on. There never was anything like it.
Whence came that indomitable spirit and courage? &#8220;A
Daughter of God&#8221; her voices called her, and truly was she so
named. For who that had not kinship with the Divine could
transcend the weakness of the flesh as did this girl of seventeen?</p>
<p>Fiercer grew the din, and fiercer. The heat became stifling.
Hours passed, and the day waxed old. The sun set; twilight
fell, and the dusk came. The shots were fewer and more scattering,
and then they stopped. The two French captains had
had enough for one day, for the attack had been confined to
the forces under Jeanne, Rais and de Gaucourt, and the
trumpet sounded the recall. But Jeanne did not heed, but
kept crying her men on to the charge. She herself could not
move to lead them, the supporting army was out of range, and
the men would not go further without her. Gaucourt ordered
his men to bring her out of the fire. Jeanne protested, but
weeping she was carried back, set in the saddle and conveyed
back to La Chapelle. Over and over she cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;It could have been taken! It could have been taken!&#8221;</p>
<p>Early the next morning in spite of her wound she went to
Alen&ccedil;on, begging him to sound the trumpets and mount for
the return to Paris.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never will I leave,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;until the city is taken.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></div>
<p>Alen&ccedil;on was of like mind, but some of the captains thought
otherwise. Some of the troops were reluctant to assault again;
for there were whispers that the Maid had failed. That she
had promised them to enter the city, and Paris had not been
taken. They recalled the omen of the mystic sword, and shook
their heads. They had forgotten that it took nearly a week to
free Orl&eacute;ans from the siege, and Paris was a larger city.
Jeanne had had but part of one day for the attack. While the
captains were debating the advisability of renewing the assault
a cavalcade of fifty or sixty gentlemen under the Baron
de Montmorency, who had been a Burgundian for many years,
rode up, and offered his services to the Maid. It was a joyful
augury, and it was so encouraging that an immediate assault
was planned. Just as they were setting forth two gentlemen
arrived from St. Denys. They were Ren&eacute; Duc de Bar, and
Charles de Bourbon, and they bore the King&#8217;s orders that no
further attack upon Paris should be made, and that the Maid
with the other leaders must return at once to St. Denys.</p>
<p>There was a storm of remonstrance and appeal, but the gentlemen
were peremptory in their insistence. Such a command
could not be disregarded, so with heavy hearts the entire force
obeyed the summons. As they had expected that the attack
would be renewed the following day the siege material had been
left on the field, and there was not time to return for it. The
King made no explanation when they reached St. Denys, and
disconsolately the captains discussed the matter.</p>
<p>Now Alen&ccedil;on had built a bridge across the Seine above
Paris, expecting to make an onset upon the south as well as
the north of the city, and Jeanne and he decided secretly to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
make a new effort in that direction. Accordingly they slipped
away very early the next morning, which was September tenth,
with a few chosen troops, and rode hastily to the place. The
bridge was in ruins. It had been destroyed in the night; not
by their enemies, but by the <i>King</i>. Sadly the two with their
men rode back to the &#8220;City of the Tomb,&#8221; which had become
the grave of their hopes.</p>
<p>Jeanne&#8217;s heart was hot with disappointment and the thwarting
of all her plans, and leaving Alen&ccedil;on she crept painfully to
the chapel of the Abbey, and knelt for a long time before the
image of the Virgin. After a time she rose, and slowly, awkwardly,
for she was without her squire, unbuckled her armour,
and laid it piece by piece upon the altar, until at length the complete
suit lay there. With a gesture of infinite yearning she
stretched her hands over it.</p>
<p>&#8220;To Saint Denys,&#8221; she said with quivering lips. Turning
she went slowly from the Abbey.</p>
<p>Jeanne, the invincible Maid, had met her first defeat at the
hands of her King.</p>

<p>No longer buoyed up by hope Jeanne began to feel her
wound to faintness, and was compelled to seek her
room for rest. As she lay on her bed, despondent and
heavy-hearted, her Saints came to her with words of comfort.
Daily they appeared, but since the crowning of Charles at
Reims they had given the maiden no specific direction. There
had been no further definite message. They had said, &#8220;Raise
the siege of Orl&eacute;ans and lead the Dauphin to his crowning&#8221;;
and she had done both things. Now they consoled the girl in
her humiliation and sorrow, and uttered a message:</p>
<p>&#8220;Remain at St. Denys, Daughter of God,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Remain
at St. Denys.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Jeanne resolved to do so, but this was not allowed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
After a few days Charles announced his intention of returning
to the Loire, and ordered the army to make ready for
the march. And now the cause of the shameful treason at
Paris was learned. There was a new treaty with Burgundy.
Charles had signed it just before coming to St. Denys. La
<ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''Tr&eacute;mou&iuml;lle'' in original text">Tr&eacute;mouille</ins> and his party had triumphed, and an inglorious
armistice which was to last until Christmas was the result.
The position of the Favorite was becoming precarious under
the great national feeling that was beginning to sweep the land,
and his only safety from his foes was to keep his hold upon
Charles. To this end the King was persuaded to consent to
the abandonment of the campaign. Charles was not difficult
to win over, for by so doing he would be left in peace to pursue
his pleasures, and La <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''Tr&eacute;mou&iuml;lle'' in original text">Tr&eacute;mouille</ins> would be free to misrule
France as he liked.</p>
<p>The truce covered the whole of the country north of the
Seine from Nogent, sixty miles above Paris, to the sea. While
it lasted Charles might not receive the submission of any city
or town, however desirous it might be to acknowledge him,
although strangely enough he might attack Paris, while equally
as strange, Burgundy might assist the Regent to defend it
against him. Compi&egrave;gne was to be given as hostage to Burgundy.
The French hoped by giving him this city that he
might be drawn from the English alliance.</p>
<p>Compi&egrave;gne, however, refused to be given, thereby showing
more loyalty to the cause of France than did the poor stick of a
King. Burgundy entered into the truce for his own purposes,
playing France against England to increase his power at
French expense. Philip was justified in seeking a truce, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
many towns which had been Burgundian had thrown off such
allegiance, and turned to Charles. He wished to prevent such
desertions for the future. England might come into this peace
at any time if she wished. This left England free to wage war
against France, and the French could move against the English,
but not if any stronghold was held for the English by the
Burgundians. It is difficult to see what France hoped to
gain by such an armistice, though there were those among
the Councillors who sincerely believed that from the arrangement
a lasting peace might result both with Burgundy and the
English. Later it was learned how Burgundy had beguiled
them. Alen&ccedil;on and the captains denounced the truce bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the King had taken Paris, he could have made his own
terms with Philip,&#8221; the young duke told Jeanne.</p>
<p>&#8220;The noble King is deceived,&#8221; said the girl sorrowfully.
&#8220;There will be no peace with Burgundy for six years, and not
until seven are sped shall the King enter his capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne, do you in truth know that?&#8221; questioned the young
man quickly. &#8220;You speak as though you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do know, gentle duke. My Voices have told me. Paris
would have been ours had we but persisted in the attack, and
in a few months northern France would have been clear of the
English. Now it will take twenty years to drive them out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty years,&#8221; repeated Alen&ccedil;on aghast. &#8220;Have your
voices told you that also, Jeanne?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, fair duke. And the pity of it! Oh, the pity of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The pity of it,&#8221; he echoed. &#8220;For now we must start for
the Loire, leaving all these cities and towns that have made
submission to Charles to the mercies of the Regent. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
have written piteous letters to the King, entreating him not to
abandon them, but he consoles them by telling them that he is
withdrawing because he does not wish to strip the country to
feed the army; yet the English are left free to harry the towns,
and their state will be worse than before they made submission.
We should not leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not go,&#8221; returned Jeanne quietly. &#8220;My Voices have
told me to remain at St. Denys. I shall obey them.&#8221;</p>
<p>She reckoned without her host. When the King was ready
to march he commanded her attendance. She refused to go.
She had never disobeyed her Heavenly Guides, she told him, so
she gave the King her duty, and begged of him to let her stay.
Charles was not minded to do this, so he ordered that she be
brought along. Jeanne&#8217;s wound was not yet healed, and she
was scarcely able to get about. So the helpless maiden was
forced against her will to go with the King.</p>
<p>It was a dreary march back to Gien, but it was made quickly.
So eager was the King to return to his amusements that the
one hundred and fifty miles&#8217; distance from St. Denys to Gien
was traversed in eight days. When the city was reached
Charles disbanded the army; so that of all the great number
of men who had set forth from the place three months agone
with banners flying nothing remained but the men of the King&#8217;s
body guard. Some were free lances from many lands, but
for the most part they were French gentlemen who had served
without pay for the love of France and the Maid. Jeanne took
farewell of them with sadness: the brave Dunois, the bold La
Hire, Poton Zaintrailles, Boussac, Culent, and others. The
great army was never mustered again.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span></div>
<p>Normandy, being an English possession, was exempt from
the truce, so Alen&ccedil;on prayed permission to lead troops against
the English strongholds there, wishing also to take the Maid
with him. &#8220;For many,&#8221; he said, &#8220;would come with them for
her sake who would not budge without her.&#8221;</p>
<p>But neither the King nor La <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''Tr&eacute;mou&iuml;lle'' in original text">Tr&eacute;mouille</ins> would grant the
grace. They did not wish the ardent young prince to become
a leader of the French against the enemy, and the Maid had
become too much of a power to be lost sight of. So firmly and
decidedly the project was dismissed, and he was relieved of his
command. In disgust the young duke retired to his estates.
He and Jeanne had grown to be great friends. He believed
in her implicitly, and she was fond of him that he did so believe;
and also because of his nobility of character, and his connection
with the house of Orl&eacute;ans. It was the last time that
they ever met. &#8220;And thus was broken the spirit of the Maid,
and of the army.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0023' id='FNanchor_0023'></a><a href='#Footnote_0023' class='fnanchor'>[23]</a></p>
<p>Jeanne pined in the days that followed; for the Court drifted
from castle to castle and from town to town in search of amusement.
Its frivolity and idle merrymaking were not to her liking,
but she was forced to follow in its train. She had her own
Household, to which were now added women and maidens of
rank, and everything which could show that she was one whom
the King delighted to honor. The Queen came up from
Bourges, and gave her a warm welcome. Rich apparel, gorgeous
in coloring, was bestowed upon her, and, be it said to the
credit of Charles, she was not stinted for money. The King
was not ungrateful. He knew that it was almost impossible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
to estimate the moral effects of Jeanne&#8217;s victories about Orl&eacute;ans
and upon the Loire. All Europe was filled with wonder,
and sent eagerly to him for news of her. All this he knew,
but he misjudged the girl, and tried to pay his debt to her by
showering gifts upon her when she wanted only to fight for
France. Pretty clothes and a life of ease might satisfy other
girls, but not Jeanne D&#8217;Arc, who lived only for the welfare
of the country. Had Charles but availed himself of her influence,
the splendid confidence of his soldiers, and the loyalty
of the country people, treating with Burgundy after taking
Paris, it is more than likely that the English power in France
would have been broken in 1429 as quickly as it was twenty
years later.</p>
<p>There was one who recognized Jeanne&#8217;s services to the
French to the full: the English Regent, Bedford. Writing
to England four years later he acknowledged that the gains
France had made against England were due mainly to the
&#8220;panic caused by the Maid, and the encouragement given by her
to the French.&#8221; Had Bedford been King of France he would
have known how to use such a power.</p>
<p>The leaders did not mind if Jeanne worked, but they were not
desirous that there should be more individual triumphs. It
threw their own treachery to the realm into strong relief, and
made for their downfall. On the upper Loire were several
strongholds which did not come under the truce with Burgundy,
and these might be proceeded against with impunity. The
strong town of La Charit&eacute; was held by Perrinet Gressart, who
had begun life as a mason but, war being the best trade, made
a fine living out of the rich district of the upper Loire. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
was in a measure under Philip of Burgundy, but when the
duke pressed him too hard he threatened to sell out to the
enemy, so that he was left in peace to pillage to his heart&#8217;s content.
Early in his career this soldier of fortune had seized La
<ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''Tr&eacute;mou&iuml;lle'' in original text">Tr&eacute;mouille</ins> as he was passing through the Burgundian country,
and the rich favorite was allowed to proceed on his journey
only at the price of a month&#8217;s captivity and a heavy ransom.</p>
<p>The little town of St. Pierre le Moustier, which stood about
thirty-five miles above La Charit&eacute;, was held by a Spanish Free
Lance who had married a niece of Gressart. Its garrison
waged a war of wastry, pillaging the peasants and the country
far and wide, and holding all whom they could take to ransom.
It was decided to launch an expedition against these strongholds
under Jeanne. If they fell it would satisfy the grudge
that La <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''Tr&eacute;mou&iuml;lle'' in original text">Tr&eacute;mouille</ins> held for his captivity; if they did not fall
there would be further loss of Jeanne&#8217;s influence, and the favorite
would be rid of a danger that was threatening his control
of France.</p>
<p>Jeanne preferred to go against Paris, but the capital was
at this time under the government of Burgundy, who had been
appointed lieutenant by Bedford, and therefore was within the
truce. So, glad of any sort of a dash against the enemy,
Jeanne went to Bourges to muster the men. The force was
to be under d&#8217;Albret, a son-in-law of La <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''Tr&eacute;mou&iuml;lle'' in original text">Tr&eacute;mouille</ins>, a man not
inclined to be friendly to the Maid. By the end of October
all was in readiness, and it was decided to go against St. Pierre
le Moustier before marching against La Charit&eacute;. It was a
strong little town with fosses, towers, and high walls some two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
miles east of the River Allier, overlooking the fields which lay
between the walls and the river.</p>
<p>The town was plied by the artillery for several days, and
after a breach was made Jeanne ordered an assault, herself
leading with standard in hand. The men rushed to the walls,
but were driven back; the retreat sounded, and the troops were
retiring from the point of attack when Jean D&#8217;Aulon, Jeanne&#8217;s
squire, being himself wounded in the heel and unable to stand
or walk, saw the Maid standing almost alone near the walls.
He dragged himself up as well as he could upon his horse, and
galloped up to her, crying:</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here alone, Pucelle? Why do you not
retreat with the others?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alone?&#8221; questioned Jeanne, raising the visor of her helmet
and gazing at him with glowing eyes. &#8220;I am not alone. Fifty
thousand of my people are about me. I will not leave until
this town is mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The squire looked about him in bewilderment, for there were
not more than five men of her Household near her, yet there
she stood waving her standard while the arrows and bolts from
the town rained and whistled about her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mistaken, Jeanne,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I see not such a
host. Come away, I beseech you. The troops are in full retreat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look after the screens and faggots,&#8221; ordered the Maid.
Mystified, the worthy man did as he was bid, while the clear
voice rang out the command:</p>
<p>&#8220;To the bridge, every man of you.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></div>
<p>Back came the men on the run with planks and faggots, and
so filling the moat returned to the assault, and the town was
taken. D&#8217;Aulon watched the onslaught in wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;The deed is divine,&#8221; he exclaimed in amazement. &#8220;Truly
the will and the guidance of our Lord are with her, else how
could so young a maid accomplish such a marvel.&#8221;</p>
<p>The town was taken, and the soldiers would have pillaged
even the churches, but Jeanne, remembering Jargeau, firmly
forbade it, and nothing was stolen.</p>
<p>Then the Maid and d&#8217;Albret proceeded to Moulins, an important
town further up the river in the Bourbonnais, whence
they sent letters to the loyal towns requiring munitions for
the attack on La Charit&eacute;. It was to the interest of the neighboring
towns that this place should be cleared away, for the
garrison was a plague to the surrounding country, but only a
few of them responded to the appeal for money and supplies.
Orl&eacute;ans, generous as always, sent money, gunners, artillery and
warm clothing, but the army was ill-equipped for the siege.
Jeanne moved her forces before the strong town and settled
down for the siege, but the King neither forwarded money nor
supplies. Riom promised money, but that was the end of it.
Left without the munitions necessary, her army ill-fed, ill-clothed
against the bitter November weather, Jeanne wrote
to the citizens of Bourges an urgent appeal. &#8220;The troops must
have help,&#8221; she said, &#8220;else the siege must be abandoned, which
would be a great misfortune to your city and to all the country
of Berri.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bourges voted to send the money, but it was never received.
Vigorously the troops pummelled the strong town with what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
artillery they had, but a siege can not be prosecuted without
provisions and other supplies, and the King left them to get
along without any support. The men naturally became discontented.
A month was wasted in artillery play, and an assault
resulted only in loss of men. In great displeasure Jeanne
raised the siege. She could inspire men to fight as they never
fought before, but she could not work miracles. God would
give the victory to those who helped themselves. Hungry,
cold, disheartened troops could not fight without munitions and
provisions. So they were disbanded, and retreated from the
town, leaving some of their artillery on the field.</p>
<p>Thus ended the fighting for the year 1429, and sadly the
Maid returned to the Court. In spite of unbelief and opposition
she had accomplished incredible deeds since her setting
forth from Vaucouleurs, and would have done them again had
she not been hampered by the King and his Council.</p>
<p>Charles was at his beautiful Ch&acirc;teau at M&eacute;hun-sur-Y&egrave;vre,
where Jeanne joined him. She was overcast and sorrowful at
the failure of the siege of La Charit&eacute;. She had wished to go
into the Isle of France to help the people of the loyal towns
there, whose state was pitiful, but had been sent on the unsuccessful
expedition instead. Invaders and robbers alike were
made bold by the withdrawal of Charles from northern France;
and the English were active, forcing exile or death on the defenseless
people, who would not forswear their loyalty. Many
villages were forsaken, the inhabitants having been driven into
other parts of France. There was pestilence and famine everywhere.
In Paris wolves prowled openly, and its citizens died
by hundreds. Paris, the beautiful city of covered bridges,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
orchards, and vineyards and towered fortresses, had been abandoned
by the English and Burgundians to its own protection;
Burgundy going to look after his personal concerns, while Bedford
swept the adjacent country with fire and sword. She had
been needed in northern France, and Jeanne&#8217;s heart was heavy
with tenderness for the suffering people of that region.</p>
<p>Many feasts were held in her honour, and both the King
and the Queen showered attentions upon her, trying by fine
clothes and caresses to make her forget her mission and her
despair. In December the King, in the presence of La
<ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''Tr&eacute;mou&iuml;lle'' in original text">Tr&eacute;mouille</ins>, Le Macon, and other courtiers, conferred upon
Jeanne a patent of nobility, sealed with a great seal of green
wax upon ribbons of green and crimson, the Orl&eacute;ans colours.</p>
<p>&#8220;In consideration of the praiseworthy and useful services
which she has rendered to the realm and which she may still
render, and to the end that the divine glory and the memory
of such favors may endure and increase to all time, we bestow
upon our beloved Jehanne d&#8217;Ay<a name='FNanchor_0024' id='FNanchor_0024'></a><a href='#Footnote_0024' class='fnanchor'>[24]</a> the name of Du Lys in
acknowledgment of the blows which she had struck for the lilies
of France. And all her kith and kin herewith, her father,
mother, brothers and their descendants in the male and female
line to the farthest generation are also ennobled with her, and
shall also bear the name Du Lys, and shall have for their
arms a shield azure with a sword supporting the crown and
golden fleur-de-lis on either side.&#8221; Charles was a &#8220;well languaged
prince,&#8221; and he conferred the patent with fine and
noble words, but Jeanne would far rather have had a company
of men to lead into the suffering country of northern France.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
She cared nothing for either the grant of nobility or the blazon,
and never used them, preferring to be known simply as Jeanne
the Maid. Her brothers, however, Pierre and Jean, were delighted,
and ever after bore the name of Du Lys.</p>
<p>The winter passed, bringing with it Jeanne&#8217;s eighteenth
birthday. The truce with Burgundy had been extended until
Easter, and the Maid waited the festival with what grace she
could, determined that the end of the truce should find her
near Paris. March found her at Sully, where the Court was
visiting at La <ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''Tr&eacute;mou&iuml;lle'' in original text">Tr&eacute;mouille</ins>. Easter was early that year, falling
on March twenty-seventh, and as soon as it was over Jeanne left
the Court, and rode northward with her Company.</p>
<p>On her way north she heard of the disaffection of Melun, a
town some twenty-one miles south of Paris, which had been
in English hands for ten years. When the English took the
place they had locked up its brave captain, Barbazon, in
Louvier, from which place he had recently been released by La
Hire. In the Autumn of 1429 Bedford had turned the town
over to Burgundy; but during April on the return of Barbazon
the burghers rose, and turned out the captain and his Burgundian
garrison, and declared for France. It was a three
days&#8217; ride from Sully-sur-Loire to Melun across rough country
and up the long ridge of Fontainebleau forest, but Jeanne
arrived with her men in time to help the citizens resist the onset
made against the town by a company of English which had
been sent to restore the English allegiance. Joyfully they
welcomed her, giving over the defense into her charge.</p>
<p>The first thing that Jeanne did was to make a survey of the
walls, that she might consider their strength and how best to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
fortify them against assault. One warm pleasant day in April
she stood on the ramparts superintending some repairs that
she had ordered when all at once her Voices came to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daughter of God,&#8221; they said, &#8220;you will be taken before the
Feast of St. Jean. So it must be. Fear not, but accept it
with resignation. God will aid you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne stood transfixed as she heard the words. The feast
of St. Jean was near the end of June. Only two months more
in which to fight for France. Her face grew white as the words
were repeated, and a great fear fell upon her. A prisoner?
Better, far better would it be to die than to be a prisoner in the
hands of the English. All their taunts, their gibes, their
threats came to her in a rush of memory. She knew what to
expect; the stake and the fire had been held up as a menace
often enough. Terrified, the young girl fell on her knees,
uttering a broken cry of appeal:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that! Not that! Out of your grace I beseech you
that I may die in that hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fear not; so it must be,&#8221; came the reply. &#8220;Be of good
courage. God will aid you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me the hour, and the day,&#8221; she pleaded brokenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before the St. Jean. Before the St. Jean,&#8221; came the reply.
And that was all.</p>
<p>For a long moment Jeanne knelt, her face bowed upon her
hands; then she bent and kissed the ground before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;God&#8217;s Will be done,&#8221; she said. Rising she went on with
her work, as calmly, as serenely as though knowledge of her
fate had not been vouchsafed her.</p>
<p>She knew, but she did not falter. A braver deed was never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
done. Who else has shown such courage and high heart since
the beginning of the world? To know that she was to be taken,
and yet to proceed with her task as though she knew it not!
There is an ecstasy in the whirl of battle; a wild joy in the mad
charge of cavalry and the clash of steel on steel. There is
contagion in numbers filled with the thought that the enemy
must be overcome, the fortress taken; a contagion that leads to
deeds of valour. There is inspiration in the call of the bugle,
or sound of the trumpet, in the waving of banners, in the war
cries of the captains. But for the prisoner there is no ecstasy,
no joy, no valorous contagion induced by numbers, no inspiration
of music, or banners, or war cries. There are only the
chill of the dungeon, the clank of the chain, the friendless loneliness,
and at length the awful death. But with capture certain,
with the consciousness of what was in store, this girl of
eighteen went her way doing all that she could in the little time
that was left her for France.</p>
<p>The fighting of the Spring was to be along the River Oise.
While Charles and his Council had rested serenely reliant upon
the faith of Burgundy, the duke and the Regent had completed
their plans for the Spring campaign. An army, victualled in
Normandy and Picardy, was to take the towns near Paris and
thereby relieve the city, which was to be well garrisoned. Only
by recovering these towns from the French could Paris be made
secure. The good town of Compi&egrave;gne was especially to be desired,
for whosoever held Compi&egrave;gne would come in time to
hold Paris. It was thirty leagues to the north and west of the
capital, lying on the River Oise. It will be recalled that
Charles had offered the city as a bribe to Burgundy to woo
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
him from the English allegiance, but the city had refused to be
lent. It had submitted to the King and the Maid the August
before, and its people remained loyal, declaring that they would
die and see their wives and children dead before they would
yield to England or Burgundy; saying that they preferred
death to dishonour. They had imbibed Jeanne&#8217;s spirit, and
the Maid loved them.</p>
<p>It was further planned by the Regent to clear the road to
Reims so that young Henry of England might be crowned
there. Bedford was bringing him over from England for that
purpose, believing that the French would be more inclined to
support him if he were crowned at Reims. This plan was
given up, however, for Burgundy warned Bedford against attempting
to imitate the feat of the Maid, saying that it was too
difficult. So the real objective of the spring campaign became
Compi&egrave;gne, other movements being to relieve Paris, and
to distract the French on their rear. For the French were
rising; rising without their King. All over northern France
there were stir and activity as troops began to gather to go
against the enemy.</p>
<p>From Melun Jeanne journeyed to Lagny, which was but a
short distance away, but the road was through a country full
of enemies, in which she was subject to attack from every direction.
It was one of the towns recovered for France the August
before, and was now held for Ambrose de Lor&eacute; by Foucault
with a garrison of Scots under Kennedy, and a Lombard soldier
of fortune, Baretta, with his company of men-at-arms, cross-bowmen
and archers. It was making &#8220;good war on the English
in Paris,&#8221; and &#8220;choking the heart of the kingdom.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span></div>
<p>Paris itself became greatly excited when it heard of the
arrival of the Maid at Lagny, its ill-neighbor, and feared that
she was coming to renew her attack on the city. Among the
English also there was consternation when the tidings spread
that again Jeanne had taken to the field. &#8220;The witch is out
again,&#8221; they declared to their captains when the officers sought
to embark troops for France, and many refused to go. They
deserted in crowds. Beating and imprisonment had no effect
upon them, and only those who could not escape were forced
on board.</p>
<p>Jeanne had scarcely reached Lagny when news came that a
band of Anglo-Burgundians was traversing the Isle of France,
under one Franquet d&#8217;Arras, burning and pillaging the country,
damaging it as much as they could. The Maid, with Foucault,
Kennedy and Baretta, determined to go against the freebooters.</p>
<p>They came up with the raiders when they were laying siege
to a castle, and were laden with the spoils of a recently sacked
village. The assault was made, and &#8220;hard work the French
had of it,&#8221; for the enemy was superior in numbers. But after
a &#8220;bloody fight&#8221; they were all taken or slain, with losses also
to the French in killed and wounded.</p>
<p>For some reason the leader, Franquet d&#8217;Arras, was given to
Jeanne. There had been an Armagnac plot in Paris in March
to deliver the city to the loyalists, but it had failed. The Maid
hoped to exchange the leader of the freebooters for one of the
chief conspirators who had been imprisoned, but it was found
that the man had died in prison, so the burghers demanded
Franquet of Jeanne, claiming that he should be tried as a murderer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
and thief by the civil law. Jeanne did as requested,
saying as she released him to the Bailly of Senlis:</p>
<p>&#8220;As my man is dead, do with the other what you should do
for justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Franquet&#8217;s trial lasted two weeks; he confessed to the charges
against him, and was executed. The Burgundians although
accustomed to robbery, murder and treachery, charged Jeanne
with being guilty of his death, and later this was made a great
point against her.</p>
<p>There was another happening at Lagny that was later made
the basis of a charge against the Maid. A babe about three
days old died, and so short a time had it lived that it had not
received the rites of baptism, and must needs therefore be
buried in unconsecrated ground. In accordance with the custom
in such cases the child was placed upon the altar in the
hope of a miracle, and the parents came to Jeanne requesting
her to join with the maidens of the town who were assembled
in the church praying God to restore life that the little one
might be baptized.</p>
<p>Jeanne neither worked, nor professed to work miracles.
She did not pretend to heal people by touching them with her
ring, nor did the people attribute miracles to her. But she
joined the praying girls in the church, and entreated Heaven
to restore the infant to life, if only for so brief a space of time
as might allow it to be received into the Church. Now as they
knelt and prayed the little one seemed suddenly to move. It
gasped three times and its color began to come back.</p>
<p>Crying, &#8220;A miracle! A miracle!&#8221; the maidens ran for the
priest, and brought him. When he came to the side of the child
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
he saw that it was indeed alive, and straightway baptized it and
received it into the Church. And as soon as this had been
done the little life that had flared up so suddenly went out,
and the infant was buried in holy ground. If receiving an
answer to earnest prayer be witchcraft were not the maidens
of Lagny equally guilty with Jeanne? But this act was later
included in the list of charges brought against her.</p>
<p>From Lagny Jeanne went to various other places in danger,
or that needed encouragement or help. She made two hurried
visits to Compi&egrave;gne which was being menaced in more than one
direction by both parties of the enemy, and was now at Soissons,
now at Senlis, and presently in the latter part of May came to
<ins class="tnchg" title="Was ''Cr&eacute;py en Valois'' in original text">Cr&eacute;py-en-Valois</ins>.</p>
<p>And here came the news that Compi&egrave;gne was being invested
on all sides, and that preparations to press the siege were being
actively made. Eager to go at once to the aid of the place
Jeanne ordered her men to get ready for the march. She had
but few in her company, not more than two or three hundred,
and some of them told her that they were too few to pass
through the hosts of the enemy. A warning of this sort never
had any effect upon Jeanne.</p>
<p>&#8220;By my staff, we are enough,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I will go to see
my good friends at Compi&egrave;gne.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0025' id='FNanchor_0025'></a><a href='#Footnote_0025' class='fnanchor'>[25]</a></p>
<p>At midnight of the twenty-second, therefore, she set forth
from Cr&eacute;py, and by hard riding arrived at Compi&egrave;gne in the
early dawn, to the great joy and surprise of the Governor,
Guillaume de Flavy, and the people who set the bells to ringing
and the trumpets to sounding a glad welcome.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span></div>
<p>The men-at-arms were weary with the night&#8217;s ride, but
Jeanne, after going to mass, met with the Governor to arrange
a plan of action.</p>
<p>Now Compi&egrave;gne in situation was very like to Orl&eacute;ans, in
that it lay on a river, but it was on the south instead of the
north bank. Behind the city to the southward stretched the
great forest of Pierrefonds, and at its feet was the River Oise.
In front of the city across the river a broad meadow extended
to the low hills of Picardy. It was low land, subject to floods,
so that there was a raised road or causeway from the bridge
of Compi&egrave;gne to the foot of the hills, a mile distant. Three
villages lay on this bank: at the end of the causeway was the
tower and village of Margny, where was a camp of Burgundians;
on the left, a mile and a half below the causeway, was
Venette, where the English lay encamped; and to the right, a
league distant above the causeway, stood Clairoix, where the
Burgundians had another camp. The first defence of the city,
facing the enemy, was a bridge fortified with a tower and boulevard,
which were in turn guarded by a deep fosse.</p>
<p>It was Jeanne&#8217;s plan to make a sally in the late afternoon
when an attack would not be expected, against Margny, which
lay at the other end of the raised road. Margny taken, she
would turn to the right and strike at Clairoix, the second Burgundian
camp, and so cut off the Burgundians from their
English allies at Venette. De Flavy agreed to the sortie, and
proposed to line the ramparts of the boulevard with culverins,
men, archers, and cross-bowmen to keep the English troops
from coming up from below and seizing the causeway and
cutting off retreat should Jeanne have to make one; and to
station a number of small boats filled with archers along the
further bank of the river to shoot at the enemy if the troops
should be driven back, and for the rescue of such as could not
win back to the boulevard.</p>

<p>The whole of the long May day was occupied in completing
arrangements, and it was not until five o&#8217;clock in the afternoon
that everything was in readiness. It had been a beautiful
day, warm with May sunshine, but cooled by a breeze from the
west, sweet with the scent of flowers and growing grass. The
walls of the city, the windows and roofs of the houses, the
buildings on the bridge, and the streets were lined with people
waiting to see the Maid and her companions set forth. Presently
Jeanne appeared, standard in hand, mounted on a great
grey horse, and clad in a rich hucque of crimson cramoisie over
her armour. At sight of her the people went wild with joy,
shouting:</p>
<p>&#8220;No&euml;l! No&euml;l! No&euml;l!&#8221; while women and girls threw flowers
before her. Jeanne turned a happy face toward them,
bowing and smiling, as she rode forth to her last field.</p>
<p>With her rode D&#8217;Aulon, his brother, Pothon le Bourgnignon,
her brothers, Jean and Pierre, and her Confessor, Father
Pasquerel, and a company of five hundred men. Across the
bridge they clattered, then took at speed the long line of the
causeway to Margny.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forward! they are ours!&#8221; called Jeanne&#8217;s clear voice as the
village was reached.</p>
<p>With a shout the troops hurled themselves upon the Burgundians,
taking the enemy completely by surprise. A scene of
confusion ensued. There were cries of triumph from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
French as they chased the Burgundians hither and thither, and
cries of dismay and clashing of steel from the Burgundians as
they scattered before the French through the village. Everything
was going as the Maid had planned; for the town was
taken.</p>
<p>Just at this juncture Jean de Luxembourg, commander of
the Burgundian camp at Clairoix, with several companions, was
riding from Clairoix on a visit to the commander at Margny.
They had drawn rein on the cliff above Margny, and were discussing
the defences of Compi&egrave;gne when, hearing the clash of
arms, they looked over the bluff and saw the scrimmage.
Wheeling, they made for Clairoix, and brought up their troops
on a gallop. To render the post of Margny untenable took
time; so when, flushed with triumph, Jeanne&#8217;s men turned into
the plain toward Clairoix, Luxembourg&#8217;s men-at-arms set upon
them, attacking their right flank. The French rolled back,
overwhelmed by the onslaught. Rallying her men, Jeanne
charged, and swept back the enemy. Again the French were
repulsed; again the Maid drove back the Burgundians; and
thus the fray raged on the flat ground of the meadow, first in
favor of the one, and then of the other. As they surged with
this alternative of advance and retreat the French were pressed
back to the causeway. And then, as reinforcements of the Burgundians
continued to arrive a panic suddenly seized the
French, and they broke and ran for the bridge and the boats.
In vain Jeanne tried to rally them to the charge. For once
they were deaf to her voice.</p>
<p>Caring only for the safety of her band Jeanne covered the
rear, charging the enemy with those who remained with her,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
with such effect that they were driven back full half the length
of the causeway. &#8220;She that was the chief and most valiant of
her band, doing deeds beyond the nature of woman.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0026' id='FNanchor_0026'></a><a href='#Footnote_0026' class='fnanchor'>[26]</a></p>
<p>Suddenly there sounded a loud hurrah, and from a little wood
on the left there came galloping and running across the meadow
land from Venette the men-at-arms and the archers of England.
Assailed on all sides, for the Burgundians at Margny had rallied
and re-entered the fray, the confusion of the French became
extreme. A struggling, seething mass of fugitives
crowded the causeway, running for their lives. Men and foot
soldiers, and behind them mounted men-at-arms, spurring hard,
and all making for the boulevard. The gunners on the walls
trained their cannon on the mass of men, but fugitives and
enemy were so commingled that friend and foe could not be distinguished,
and they dared not fire. And De Flavy did
nothing.</p>
<p>Roused to the danger of their position D&#8217;Aulon entreated
Jeanne to make for the town.</p>
<p>&#8220;The day is lost, Pucelle,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;All are in retreat.
Make for the town.&#8221; But Jeanne shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;To the charge!&#8221;</p>
<p>D&#8217;Aulon, Jean and Pierre, her brothers, all her own little
company, closed around her, resolved to sell their lives dearly
in her defence, and D&#8217;Aulon and Pierre, seizing hold of her
bridle rein, forcibly turned her toward the town, carrying her
back in spite of herself.</p>
<p>But now they were assailed from all sides, the little company
fighting, struggling, contesting every inch of ground, beating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
off their adversaries, and advancing little by little toward the
boulevard.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall make it, Jeanne,&#8221; exulted Pierre D&#8217;Arc when they
were within a stone&#8217;s throw of the walls, but the words died
on his lips, for at this moment came a ringing order from the
gate:</p>
<p>&#8220;Up drawbridge: close gates: down portcullis!&#8221;</p>
<p>Instantly the drawbridge flew up, down came the portcullis,
the gates were closed and barred. Jeanne the Maid was shut
out.</p>
<p>A groan came from Pierre&#8217;s lips, but his sister smiled at him
bravely; as old D&#8217;Aulon shouted:</p>
<p>&#8220;Treachery! In God&#8217;s name, open for the Maid.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the gates were closed, and the drawbridge remained up.
There was a second&#8217;s interchange of looks between the brothers
and sister as the enemy with shouts of triumph closed around
them in overwhelming numbers. Only a second, but in that
brief time they took a mute farewell of each other. Man after
man of the little company was cut down or made prisoner.
D&#8217;Aulon was seized, then Jean, then Pierre, and Jeanne found
herself struggling in the midst of a multitude of Anglo-Burgundians.
One seized her wrists, while a Picard archer tore
her from the saddle by the long folds of her crimson hucque,
and in a moment they were all upon her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yield your faith to me,&#8221; cried the Picard archer, who had
seized her hucque.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have given my faith to another than you, and I will keep
my oath,&#8221; rang the undaunted girl&#8217;s answer.</p>
<p>At this moment there came a wild clamour of bells from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
churches of Compi&egrave;gne in a turbulent call to arms to save the
Maid. Their urgent pealing sounded too late.</p>
<p>Jeanne D&#8217;Arc had fought on her last field. The inspired
Maid was a prisoner.</p>

<p>There were shouts of triumph and exultation as the
Maid was led back over the causeway to Margny.
The sun had long since set, and the dusk was dying
down into darkness. All along the causeway the earth was
stained with blood, and sown with broken swords, scraps of
armour, and the dead of friend and foe united now in the peace
of mortality. Jeanne was too great a prize for a mere archer
to claim, so Jean de Luxembourg bought her immediately from
the man, allowing him to retain her hucque of crimson
cramoisie, her saddle cloth, and horse with caparisons. Then
she was taken to his camp at Clairoix.</p>
<p>Thither came also the great Duke of Burgundy from his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
camp at Coudon, eager to see the girl who had almost uprooted
the dominion of the English in France. Thither also
assembled the English and Burgundians from the other camps
in numbers, with cries and rejoicings over the taking of the
Maid. Had a great victory been won the effect could not have
been greater. It broke the spell. The Maid was human, like
other women. So they were &#8220;as joyous as if they had taken
five hundred prisoners, for they feared her more than all the
French captains put together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several times Philip of Burgundy had expressed a wish to
see Jeanne the Maid, especially after receiving her letters summoning
him to his rightful allegiance. Now as he found her
sitting calmly in the quarters to which she had been committed,
he could not forbear an exclamation of surprise at her youth
and loveliness.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are the Pucelle?&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Jeanne the Maid, messire,&#8221; she answered, regarding
him with grave earnestness. &#8220;And you, I doubt not, are that
Burgundy who hath beguiled the gentle King with fair words
and false promises?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Philip, Duke of Burgundy,&#8221; he replied haughtily.
&#8220;What I have done hath been for our royal master, Henry,
King of England and of France.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay! and for your country&#8217;s wreck and woe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are bold words, Pucelle,&#8221; ejaculated the duke, flushing.
&#8220;Have a care. Neither man nor witch may so speak to
Burgundy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My lord duke, if they be not true then most humbly do I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
entreat your pardon. If they be not true, why then do you
besiege the good city of Compi&egrave;gne, bringing suffering upon
your own people? They are French, as you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The city was promised me,&#8221; he uttered angrily. &#8220;Charles
the Dauphin gave it me. &#8217;Twas in the truce. He broke his
faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how kept you yours?&#8221; asked the girl dauntlessly. &#8220;I
think, my lord, that Paris once was promised Charles. How
was that faith kept?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Philip, without reply, turned upon his heel angrily, and
left the room. Forthwith he sent dispatches to the Regent, to
the Dukes of Brittany and Savoy, to his city of St. Quentin,
and to the town of Gand that all Christendom might know that
the Witch of the Armagnacs was taken.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the pleasure of our Blessed Creator,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;such
grace has come to pass that she whom they call the Maid has
been taken. The great news of this capture should be spread
everywhere and brought to the knowledge of all, that they may
see the error of those who could believe and lend themselves to
the pretensions of such a woman. We write this in the hope of
giving you joy, comfort, and consolation, and that you may
thank God our Creator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over France the tidings spread. From lip to lip it flew:
the Maid was taken. Paris rejoiced, showing its delight by
building bonfires and singing Te Deums in the Cathedral of
Notre Dame. In the loyal cities and in the hearts of the peasantry
there was mourning. At Tours the entire population
appeared in the streets with bare feet, singing the Miserere in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
penance and affliction. Orl&eacute;ans and Blois made public prayers
for her safety, and Reims had to be especially soothed by its
Archbishop.</p>
<p>&#8220;She would not take counsel,&#8221; wrote Regnault de Chartres,
Archbishop of Reims, who had always been an enemy to
Jeanne, &#8220;but did everything according to her own will. But
there has lately come to the King a young shepherd boy who
says neither more nor less than Jeanne the Maid. He is commanded
by God to go to the King, and defeat the English and
Burgundians. He says that God suffered her to be taken
because she was puffed up with pride, loved fine clothes, and
preferred her own pleasure to any guidance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The archbishop&#8217;s letter silenced Reims and other cities.
Silenced their outcries, that is, for they continued to send
petitions to the King pleading that he would gather the money
for her ransom, but he did nothing. Another Archbishop,
Jacques G&eacute;lu, of Embrun, who had written Charles in favor
of Jeanne after Orl&eacute;ans now addressed some bold words to the
monarch on her behalf:</p>
<p>&#8220;For the recovery of this girl, and for the ransom of her life,
I bid you spare neither means nor money, howsoever great the
price, unless you would incur the indelible shame of most disgraceful
ingratitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the King preferred the &#8220;indelible shame of disgraceful
ingratitude,&#8221; for he made no effort of any sort for Jeanne&#8217;s
ransom or rescue. He had been a poor discredited Dauphin,
with doubts as to his own claims to the throne, contemplating
flight into Scotland or Spain when Jeanne came to him at
Chinon. She had resolved his doubts, restored the realm, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
made him King with the sacred oil upon his brow, yet he preferred
to keep his money for his pleasures than to give it for the
maiden who had done so much for him. Charles the Seventh of
France has been called Charles the Well-served, Charles the
Victorious, and he is rightly so called; for it was always others
who did his work for him, and won his victories; but Charles
the Dastard is the best appellation that can be given him.
The ingratitude of Princes is well known, but the heart sickens
before such baseness as he showed toward the Maid of Orl&eacute;ans,
and the mind revolts from the thought that human nature can
sink to such depths.</p>
<p>But if Charles and the French were indifferent to the value
of Jeanne others were not. The University of Paris upon
receipt of the news of her capture sent at once to Burgundy,
demanding that Jean de Luxembourg send forthwith &#8220;this
Jeanne, violently suspected of many crimes touching heresy, to
appear before the Council of Holy Inquisition.&#8221; A second
letter followed this appeal, saying that it was &#8220;feared that the
woman would be put out of their jurisdiction in some manner.&#8221;
The University feared without cause, for no attempt
was ever made to redeem the girl whose only crime was to have
defended, with matchless heroism, her country and her King.</p>
<p>Back of the University stood the English, who were eager
to get possession of her person, and were willing to pay even
princely rewards for her delivery into their hands. They had
their vengeance to gratify. They had always threatened to
burn her if they caught her, and could she be condemned and
executed as a sorceress Charles of Valois would be dishonoured
through her who had crowned him, and it would appear that his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
cause was not the true one; that Henry of England was the
true sovereign of France. Most Englishmen believed that
Jeanne was really a witch, for at this time no man believed that
she could accomplish her deeds without supernatural aid. Consequently,
as the English did not wish to think that God was
against them they pronounced her aid to be from the Evil One.
So Pierre Cauchon, the Bishop of Beauvais, was sent by Bedford
to Jean de Luxembourg to negotiate the purchase of the
Maid. He was an enemy of France; he had a personal grudge
toward Jeanne because through her success in arms he had
been expelled from his diocese, and was just the right sort of
man to send for dickering in such a trade. Jean de Luxembourg
was needy, and already in the pay of the English, but he
did not wish to let his prize go until he had his money, so
Jeanne was sent north to Beaulieu in the Vermandois, where he
had a strong castle, until the arrangements were perfected for
her sale.</p>
<p>D&#8217;Aulon, her squire, was sent with her, for during this period
of imprisonment Jeanne was treated honourably, and allowed
attendance. She was cheerful and hopeful at Beaulieu for a
time, and one day D&#8217;Aulon said to her:</p>
<p>&#8220;That poor town of Compi&egrave;gne, which you loved so dearly,
will now be placed in the hands of the enemies of France.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It shall not be,&#8221; cried Jeanne in a flash of inspiration, &#8220;for
no place which the King of Heaven has put in the hands of the
gentle King Charles by my aid, shall be retaken by his enemies
while he does his best to keep them.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, in spite of these brave words, the fate of the town hung
heavy upon her spirit. Her guards told her tales of how the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
siege was progressing, and of the sufferings of the people.
Jeanne chafed under inaction while her friends needed her, and
watched eagerly for a chance whereby she might escape and go
to their aid. She had not given her faith to any man, and was
not on parole.</p>
<p>In one side of the chamber in which she was confined there
was a window opening upon a dark corridor. Across were
nailed some narrow planks, the space between them being sufficient
for a very slender person to slip through. Jeanne
resolved to risk an attempt.</p>
<p>Her guards were in an adjoining room, which also opened
upon the dark corridor, but once past their room she believed
that she might gain the grounds of the ch&acirc;teau and from thence
reach the wooded country that lay beyond its immediate confines.
The plan worked perfectly&ndash;&ndash;to a certain point. She
was slight enough to slip between the narrow planks, which
she did, and found herself in the corridor, which was dark and
musty from long disuse. There was a huge key in the lock of
the door where the guards were, and this Jeanne turned as
noiselessly as possible, then darted away through the dim passageway.
Alas! the porter of the ch&acirc;teau, who had not the
least business in that part of the castle, suddenly came out of
another room opening upon the corridor, and confronted her.
Without ado the maiden was marched back to her chamber, like
a naughty child, and the guards were doubled.</p>
<p>&#8220;It did not please God that I should escape this time,&#8221; she
said plaintively to D&#8217;Aulon when he came to attend her.</p>
<p>Jean de Luxembourg was alarmed when he heard of the
attempt. She was too rich a prize to lose, so he sent her post
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
haste to his stronghold of Beaurevoir, which was forty miles
further north, beyond St. Quentin in the plain of Picardy,
and was the residence of his wife, aunt, and step-daughter.</p>
<p>She was shut up here at the top of a tower sixty feet high,
but notwithstanding this fact her condition was much alleviated,
for the ladies of the household visited her daily, becoming
greatly attached to her. These good women tried to get her to
lay aside her masculine attire, for it troubled and shamed them
to see her in the costume of a man. Jeanne explained courteously
her reasons for wearing the garb when they brought a
woman&#8217;s frock to her, and besought her to put it on.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is best to be so dressed while in the serious work of war,&#8221;
she told them. &#8220;When among men it is more seemly to wear
the garb of a soldier; but,&#8221; she added graciously, &#8220;were it time
for me to change the fashion of my dress I would do it for you
two ladies who have been so kind rather than for any one in
France except my Queen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many persons visited her while she was at this castle, but as
Jean de Luxembourg, the master of the house, was himself
in camp before Compi&egrave;gne there was the disadvantage of constant
news, and the girl&#8217;s anxiety became pitiable as the tidings
from her &#8220;good friends&#8221; at Compi&egrave;gne daily became more unfavourable.</p>
<p>D&#8217;Aulon was no longer with her, and for the first time Jeanne
was entirely without a friend of the old life with her. There
was no word that her King or her friends were doing anything
for her, but only talk of the English and how they wished to
buy her. Both visitors and guards told her of the besieged
city and that their sufferings were driving the citizens to desperation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
There was joy and thanksgiving in the castle upon
the coming of the heralds with dispatches that seemed to be
always to the advantage of the Burgundians. It preyed upon
the maiden&#8217;s mind; she lost confidence and hope, becoming very
despondent.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Compi&egrave;gne is taken all persons beyond the age of
seven years are to be put to the sword,&#8221; one of her visitors said
one day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would rather die than live after the destruction of such
good people,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Also I would rather die than be in
the hands of my enemies of England.&#8221; She paced the floor in
great agitation after the visitor left her.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can God leave those good people of Compi&egrave;gne, who
have been and are so loyal to their King, to perish?&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>And the thought came to her that she must escape, that she
must go to the rescue of Compi&egrave;gne. There were blows to be
struck there that only she could strike. She must go to
Compi&egrave;gne. Jeanne was but a young girl. She could not
realize that her allotted time was over. It is hard for one to
accept the fact one is not needed; that everything can go on as
usual without one, and Jeanne was very young. All at once
the desperate expedient came to her to leap from the tower.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not leap,&#8221; admonished her Voices. &#8220;Be patient. God
will help you, and also Compi&egrave;gne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then since God will aid the good people of Compi&egrave;gne I
desire to be with them,&#8221; said Jeanne.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must bear these things gladly,&#8221; St. Catherine told her.
&#8220;Delivered you will not be until you have seen the King of
England.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Verily,&#8221; cried the Maid like the child she was, &#8220;I have no
wish to see him, and would rather die than be in English hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not leap,&#8221; came from St. Catherine again. &#8220;Be patient.
All will be well.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jeanne was wrought up to too great a pitch to heed.
For the first time since her Saints had come to her she deliberately
disobeyed their counsels. Going to the top of the
tower she commended herself to God and Our Lady and
leaped.</p>
<p>Some time later she was found at the foot of the tower where
she had fallen. She was insensible, and lay so long unconscious
that the Luxembourg ladies feared that she was dead. After a
time she regained consciousness, but for three days could neither
eat nor drink. The wonder is that she escaped destruction, but
no bones were broken, and she was not even seriously injured.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have sinned,&#8221; confessed the girl humbly to her Saints when
next they visited her. &#8220;I have sinned.&#8221; And of God she
asked pardon for her impatience and disobedience. She was
forgiven, and comforted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fear naught,&#8221; Saint Catherine said consolingly. &#8220;They of
Compi&egrave;gne shall have succor before St. Martin&#8217;s Day.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now having obtained forgiveness for her sin Jeanne
recovered and began to eat, and soon was well. As for Compi&egrave;gne,
it was delivered, as was foretold a fortnight before St.
Martin&#8217;s Day. The men of the town worked bravely under
De Flavy, and their courageous endurance enabled them to
hold out until the twenty-fifth of October, when they were
rescued by a concerted movement of Vend&ocirc;me and Zaintrailles,
and a sortie of the citizens. The enemy was forced to make a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
shameful retreat, being completely routed, abandoning their
artillery and supplies. Many strong towns which adjoined
Compi&egrave;gne made submission to the King, but it was the loyalty
and courage of Compi&egrave;gne that really shattered the Anglo-Burgundian
campaign of 1430.</p>
<p>Meantime Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais, was travelling
from Burgundy to Luxembourg, and thence to Bedford
in the effort to complete the sale of the maiden. Jeanne&#8217;s price
had been settled at ten thousand pounds in gold. It was the
ransom of a prince, and Jeanne was a peasant maid, but the
English had no doubt of her importance. There was delay in
raising the money, but when at last Regent Bedford received a
large sum from Normandy he set aside ten thousand pounds
which he said &#8220;were to be devoted to the purchase of Jehanne la
Pucelle, said to be a witch, and certainly a military personage,
leader of the hosts of the Dauphin.&#8221; The Demoiselle de Luxembourg
begged Jean, her nephew, not to sell the maiden
to the English. He knew, and she knew what fate lay in store
for the girl, and she besought him with tears not to take the
blood money. But, pleading poverty, de Luxembourg would
not listen, and the sale was made.</p>
<p>Jeanne now was removed to Arras, where Philip of Burgundy
held his court, and here the money passed hands. Jean
de Luxembourg received his ten thousand pounds, and Philip
of Burgundy was rewarded with political favors. Jeanne was
at last in the hands of the English, who immediately removed
her to their strong fortress of Crotoy, a castle by the sea, and
now that they had her they &#8220;rejoiced as greatly as if they had
received all the wealth of Lombardy.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span></div>
<p>But she was treated honourably here, like any prisoner of
war. Once too some ladies of Abbeville, five leagues from
Crotoy, came down the River Somme in a boat to see her. As
were all women, they were much pleased with the gentle
maiden, and wept when they took leave of her, kissing her
affectionately, and wishing her all sorts of favours from
Heaven. Jeanne thanked them warmly for their visit, and
commended herself to their prayers. Another comfort was
vouchsafed her here: a fellow prisoner, a priest in a dungeon
of Crotoy, was allowed to visit her daily to say mass and to give
her the holy communion. So that the month of her stay served
to soothe and calm her mind, and give her fortitude for what
was to come.</p>
<p>The University of Paris was becoming impatient for its prey.
Its offer to see her to a speedy condemnation had not been
accepted, and a sharp letter was sent to Pierre Cauchon saying
that if he had been more diligent the &#8220;cause of the woman would
already have been before the ecclesiastical court.&#8221; But it was
not the fault of Cauchon, but of the English, who had hesitated
about taking the Maid for trial to Paris. It was unquiet in the
Ile de France, and all the northern country seemed turning
again toward Charles; therefore there might be danger of
Jeanne being captured by the French before Paris could be
reached. Nor did they wish to take her to England. It was
decided, in consequence, to hold the trial in Rouen in Normandy,
where they were most strong, under the zealous Pierre
Cauchon, and an officer of the Holy Inquisition to sit with him
as co-judge.</p>
<p>So again Jeanne&#8217;s prison was changed. At the end of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
year she was taken from Crotoy, and, travelling slowly along
the coast, reached Rouen by way of Eu and Dieppe, as far away
as possible from any risk of rescue. It was in the beginning of
the year 1431 that she arrived at Rouen, and at once she was
taken to the castle and lodged in its great tower. It was a
gloomy edifice, and the room to which she was assigned was
in the first story, up eight steps from the postern gate, where
light and air struggled feebly through a narrow slit through the
twelve foot wall.</p>
<p>The severities inflicted upon her here were terrible. For
the first time she was heavily fettered; even at night her ankles
were ironed and fastened to a chain which passed under her
bed and was locked to a heavy beam at the foot. Hands, feet
and throat were bound to a pillar, and she was kept in an iron
cage, or huche. Also, because it was their policy to degrade
her as well as to keep her, five rude English soldiers from the
lowest class were given her for guards. Three of these were
always to be in her room night and day, and two outside. The
whole being sickens, and is filled with rage, and shame, and
burning indignation at the cruelties that were inflicted upon
this modest young girl. Where were La Hire, Dunois,
Alen&ccedil;on, Boussac, Rais, and other captains that no sword was
drawn for Jeanne?</p>
<p>Oh, shame to England that so used her! And ten times
shame to France who deserted her and sold her! A blot upon
England? Yes. And upon France that she had saved. A
stain that can never be obliterated as long as the world stands.
She was a woman in the age of chivalry, when women were supposed
to be the objects of a kind of worship, every knight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
being sworn to succor and help them in need and trouble. And
the &#8220;Chivalry of England shamefully used and destroyed her;
the Chivalry of France deserted and sold her.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0027' id='FNanchor_0027'></a><a href='#Footnote_0027' class='fnanchor'>[27]</a></p>
<p>She was to be tried by the Church, yet she was placed in a
military prison, instead of an ecclesiastical one guarded by
women. There was but one solace; many times a day her
Saints came to her whispering words of comfort and consolation.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do not always understand,&#8221; said the maiden afterward
before her judges, &#8220;because of the disturbance in the
prison, and the noise made by the guards.&#8221;</p>
<p>And thus, in chains, in an iron cage, Jeanne D&#8217;Arc passed
her nineteenth birthday.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>The days passed drearily enough in the prison cell, but
Jeanne endured the chains, the irons, and the hideous
company of the guards rather than give her parole not
to attempt an escape. The monotony of her misery was varied
by visitors who came to stare at her and to banter her.</p>
<p>In the castle in which she was confined there were many
people: Bedford, the Regent, Beaufort, the Cardinal of Winchester,
the child king, Henry of England, the Earl of Warwick,
the chief officers of both the royal and vice-royal court,
and a host of guards and men-at-arms. There were many of
these who were inquisitive and malicious concerning her. One
of the visitors was Pierre Manuel, advocate of the King of
England.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would not have come here if you had not been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
brought,&#8221; he accosted her jestingly. &#8220;Did you know before
you were taken that you would be captured?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feared it,&#8221; Jeanne answered sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you feared it, why were you not on your guard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not know the day nor the hour,&#8221; she answered patiently.</p>
<p>The Earl of Warwick himself took more than one occasion to
show Jeanne to his friends, and one day he brought the Earl of
Stafford and Jean de Luxembourg to see her. De Luxembourg
was the same who had sold her to the English.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeanne, I have come to ransom you,&#8221; remarked the latter
laughingly as the girl rose to a sitting posture from the bed
where she was chained to give them courteous greeting. &#8220;That
is, if you will promise never again to bear arms against us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name, you mock me,&#8221; she cried with a flash of
spirit. &#8220;I know that you have neither the will nor the power.
I know that the English mean to kill me, believing, after I
am dead, that they will be able to win the Kingdom of France;
but if there were a hundred thousand more Godons than there
are, they shall never win the Kingdom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whereupon Lord Stafford was so goaded to rage that he
half drew his dagger to slay her, but Warwick stayed his hand.
It was too merciful a death, and it was the English policy to
have her executed ignominiously as a witch.</p>
<p>After long, comfortless days of waiting Jeanne was informed
that she was to be tried for heresy, and piteously she asked
that some of her own party should be placed among the judges;
but this was refused. The charge of heresy against a girl to
whom the ordinances of the Church were as the breath of life
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
seems strange. She who lived in an ecstasy of religious
fervour, who spent her time in prayer and religious exercises;
who confessed regularly, and partook of the Sacraments of
the Church whenever she could receive them, was accused by
the Church of being a heretic and schismatic. Her great crime
in the eyes of the clergy lay in affirming that she obeyed voices
that came from God.</p>
<p>In her cell Jeanne could know but little of the arrangements
that were being made for the trial, which were on such a scale
as to command the attention of all Europe. No homage ever
rendered her by her own party conveys such a sense of her
importance as this trial which was instigated by a great nation
to neutralize her influence.</p>
<p>Owing to the fact that the meadow land where she was captured
lay in the diocese of Beauvais Pierre Cauchon claimed
jurisdiction over her. He had ever been a sympathizer with
the English faction, and after Jeanne&#8217;s triumphs had swept
him out of his city he had fled for a while to England, and had
come back to France with the Cardinal of Winchester, eager
for rewards and revenge. A few months previous Winchester
had recommended him to the Pope for the vacant archbishopric
of Rouen, but his appointment was opposed by the clergy of
that city, and the Pope had not yet come to a decision. He
was a man of much learning and more ambition, and he delighted
in the opportunity now afforded him of pleasing his
English patrons, and avenging his private grudge.</p>
<p>As Cauchon was presiding officer the trial should have been
held, of course, in his diocese, but it was deemed expedient to
hold it in Rouen, on account of the disturbances near Paris, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
Canonical permission was obtained from the Cathedral Chapter
of Rouen to hold the court in that city. Bishops, abb&eacute;s, priors,
representatives of the University of Paris, learned doctors, and
noted priests, sixty of the greatest intellectuals of the Church,&ndash;&ndash;all
of them Frenchmen of the English faction,&ndash;&ndash;were gathered
together to bring to death a young, ignorant peasant girl.</p>
<p>To arrange all the preliminaries that were necessary for the
opening of the trial took time, so that it was not until toward
the last of February that everything was in readiness. Such
cases are always preceded by an inquiry into the former life of
the accused as had been done at Poictiers, for this is according
to French law. This examination was made but it was not
of a nature to justify or strengthen any accusation. All that
the examiners could discover was that Jeanne D&#8217;Arc was a
good, honest maid who had left a spotless reputation behind
her in her native village. One commissioner reported that he
had learned nothing which he would not willingly know of his
own sister, although he had made inquiries in five or six parishes.
Cauchon called him a traitor, and said that he would
not pay for information that could be of no use to him.</p>
<p>As this investigation had been productive of nothing that
could be used against her an effort was made to trap Jeanne
into admissions against herself. Accordingly one morning a
man entered her cell who represented himself as a shoemaker
coming from Lorraine. He was a prisoner, he said, but
had received permission to visit her. Jeanne was delighted to
see any one from the valley of the Meuse, so gave him cordial
greeting, and the two fell into conversation. During the talk
the supposed cobbler said suddenly in a low tone:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Pucelle, I am a priest. Nay,&#8221; as Jeanne turned toward
him with an exclamation of joy, &#8220;speak low. Some of the
guards may understand French, and I am come to help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A priest?&#8221; The maiden&#8217;s thin, white face grew radiant.
&#8220;A priest, messire? Then you can hear me in confession?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gladly, my child.&#8221; And forthwith the girl innocently
opened up her heart to him.</p>
<p>The man was in reality a priest, one Nicholas Loyseleur, a
representative of the University of Paris, and full of treachery
and hypocrisy. He served Cauchon well, for Jeanne trusted
him wholly, never dreaming that every word she said to him was
overheard and recorded by secret listeners. For there was
provision made for espionage, openings being in the walls
through which everything that took place in the room, every
proceeding could be spied upon, and every word heard. Although
the long conversations that this man held with Jeanne
elicited nothing that she did not say publicly, he was always
giving her advice which, when she followed it, she followed to
her hurt.</p>
<p>The preliminaries, as has been said, threatened to be endless,
but at length, on Wednesday, February twenty-first, the Great
Trial began at eight o&#8217;clock in the morning in the royal chapel
of the castle.</p>
<p>Jeanne gave a sigh of relief as the officer of the court, who
was sent to conduct her to the chapel, released her from her
fetters.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are summoned to appear before the court, Pucelle,&#8221;
he explained.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span></div>
<p>&#8220;May I hear mass before entering the court?&#8221; asked she
wistfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay; it is not permitted,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Come!&#8221;</p>
<p>So, surrounded by a strong guard, the Maid was led through
the corridor to the royal chapel. It was but a short distance,
but it was the first breath of fresh air that she had had in almost
two months, and Jeanne inhaled it eagerly. The chapel was
a large room, but it was not large enough to accommodate those
who sought admission. Rouen was very full of people, and
the leopards of England and the two-tailed lion of Burgundy
were to be seen on every side. There was a motley populace
of soldiers, citizens, priests and lawyers; for the Great Trial had
brought to the town any number of churchmen and men of the
robe, each with his attendant train of clerics and secretaries.</p>
<p>Forty-four of the assessors, as the assistants of Cauchon were
called, were present in the chapel ranged in a semi-circle around
the presiding Bishop. Doctors in theology, doctors in canonical
and civil law, abbots and canons were there assembled in
the solemnity of their priestly and professional robes; clerks,
ready with their pens to record proceedings, lords, and notables
of every degree of rank: all gathered to see how easily the
Witch would be undone.</p>
<p>To none of these worthies did Jeanne give attention as she
was led through the spectators to a solitary bench which stood
where all might see on a dais on one side of the room, near to
the Bishop&#8217;s stand. But, raising her large, grave eyes, she
gazed earnestly at the Judge, Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais,
who this day presided alone. It was a cold cruel face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
upon which she looked; an intellectual face also, on which
ambition sat. No man is so merciless toward an obstacle that
stands in the way of his advancement as a cold intellectual man.
Involuntarily Jeanne shuddered as she looked at him.</p>
<p>After she was seated Cauchon addressed her, summarizing
the accusations, and all the public reports and suspicions upon
which the trial was based, exhorting her sternly. Then he required
her to take the oath upon the Scriptures, to speak the
truth, and to answer all questions addressed to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know not what things I may be asked,&#8221; said Jeanne
clearly. &#8220;Perhaps you may ask me questions which I cannot
answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the sweet girlish voice rose in answer to the Bishop&#8217;s command
there was a stir in the assembly and every eye was turned
upon the maiden in the prisoner&#8217;s seat. They saw a slender
girl, just past nineteen, dressed in a page&#8217;s suit of black, her
dark hair, cut short man fashion, intensifying the pallor of her
face, and the melancholy of her large eyes. She looked very
young as she sat there, emaciated and fetter-worn from her
irons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swear to tell the truth upon whatever you may be asked
concerning the faith, and facts within your knowledge,&#8221; rejoined
the Bishop.</p>
<p>&#8220;As to my father and mother,&#8221; said Jeanne, &#8220;and what I did
after setting out for France, I will swear willingly; but the
revelations which have come to me from God I will reveal to no
man except only to Charles, my King; I shall not reveal them
to you though you cut off my head, because I have received
them by vision and by secret communication, and am forbidden.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
After a moment&#8217;s reflection she added: &#8220;Before eight
days I shall know if I may tell you of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bishop urged her again and again to take the oath without
conditions. She refused, and they were at length obliged
to offer a limited oath. Then, kneeling, Jeanne crossed her
hands upon the Missal and swore to answer truly whatever
might be asked of her, so far as she could, concerning the common
faith of Christians, but no more. Being then questioned
concerning her name and early life she answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;In my own country I was called Jeannette; ever since coming
into France<a name='FNanchor_0028' id='FNanchor_0028'></a><a href='#Footnote_0028' class='fnanchor'>[28]</a> I have been called Jeanne. I have as surname
D&#8217;Arc or Rom&eacute;e; in my country girls take the name of
their mother.&#8221; Then she told the names of her father and
mother, her godfather and godmothers, the priest who had baptized
her, the place where she was born, her age, concluding
with: &#8220;From my mother I learned my Pater, my Ave Marie,
and my Credo. From my mother I learned all that I believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say your Pater,&#8221; commanded the Bishop abruptly; for it
was believed that no witch could repeat the Lord&#8217;s Prayer
except backwards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear me in confession, and I will say it for you willingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several times she was asked to say the Pater Noster, but her
reply was always the same: &#8220;No; I will not say my Pater for
you unless you hear me in confession.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will willingly give you one or two worthy men who
speak French; will you say your Pater to them?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I shall not say it unless in confession,&#8221; was her answer,
whereby there was an implied protest to this company of
priests who had refused her all the exercises of the Church.</p>
<p>Cauchon ignored the appeal, and as the session was about to
close forbade her to leave the prison which had been assigned
her in the castle under pain of being pronounced guilty of
heresy; to this the maiden returned at once:</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not accept such an injunction. If ever I escape, no
one shall be able to reproach me with having broken my faith,
as I have not given my word to any person whatever.&#8221; Then
she complained that they bound her with chains and shackles.</p>
<p>&#8220;You tried several times to escape from the prison where
you were detained,&#8221; Cauchon reminded her, &#8220;and it was to
keep you more surely that you were ordered to be put in irons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true that I wished to get away,&#8221; said Jeanne, &#8220;and I
wish it still. Is not that a thing allowed to every prisoner?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon Cauchon called in John Grey, the English gentleman
who had charge of the prison, along with two of his
soldiers, and enjoined them to guard the girl securely and not
to permit her to talk with any one without the permission of
the court. Jeanne was then led back to her cell and her irons.</p>
<p>Now the assessors were not all agreed as to the legality of
the trial, but they feared what might befall them if they opposed
Cauchon, who wielded a great influence with the English.
One Nicolas de Houppeville of Rouen had spoken his mind
freely at the preliminary consultation, and now as he presented
himself to take a seat among the assistant judges the Bishop
had him thrown into prison. This man had said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not see how we can proceed against the prisoner, as we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
who are opposed to her are acting as judges. Furthermore, she
has already been examined by the clergy at Poictiers under the
Archbishop of Reims, who is the metropolitan of the Bishop of
Beauvais.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stated the case with clearness: the Church which had
acquitted her at Poictiers seemed now to be trying Jeanne for
the same offense. Cauchon reprimanded the priest sharply,
and it now took all the influence that could be brought to bear
upon the matter to keep him from being exiled to England.
But his misfortune had a salutary effect upon the other assessors.
Henceforth, Cauchon found the majority of them pliant
to his will.</p>
<p>There had been so much confusion at the first session, the
proceedings being much interrupted by shouts and noises from
outside, that the next morning the sitting was held in a room
at the end of the great hall of the castle. Again the captive
was unchained and brought before them&ndash;&ndash;a young girl, alone
and friendless, before a convocation of trained men, and without
counsel, advocate, or attorney. During the day before she
had been interrupted at almost every word, and secretaries of
the English King recorded her replies as they pleased, distorting
her answers as they saw fit. Guillaume Manchon of the
Cathedral Chapter, chief clerk, threatened to throw up his
task if this were further permitted, being desirous that the
records should be correctly kept. Again the Bishop asked
Jeanne to take the oath without conditions. To which she replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;I swore yesterday. That ought to suffice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every person,&#8221; said the Bishop, &#8220;though he were a prince,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
being required to swear in any matter relating to the faith,
cannot refuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I took the oath yesterday,&#8221; said she, &#8220;that ought to be sufficient
for you. You ask too much of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The contest ended as on the day before by Jeanne taking a
limited oath. Then Jean Beaup&egrave;re, a distinguished professor
in theology, resumed the examination. In all this trial Jeanne
was the only witness examined.</p>
<p>He asked about her early life, her trade, her visions, her
coming to the King, the sign she had shown him, the wearing
of male attire, and about the fairies of the Tree, and the healing
properties of the Gooseberry Spring. The questions were
purposely mixed and confused so as to entrap her into contradictions.
Again and again he returned to the Sign she had
shown to the King, and this Jeanne could not in loyalty reveal.
Had it been known that Charles had doubts concerning his
own right to the throne, it would have been claimed that he
held the crown on the strength of an assurance from a sorceress.
This Sign and the wearing of male attire were recurred to time
after time. The whole judicial process was a succession of
snares to catch an unsuspecting victim, a constant violation of
justice and the most established rights. Day after day the
interrogations continued, and the maiden evinced a courage in
facing the learned doctors and divines as great as she had ever
shown in battle. The readiness and beauty of her answers
often astonished the assembly. They asked her one day:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know that you are in the grace of God?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was an unfair question. If she replied, &#8220;yes,&#8221; she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
presumptuous; if &#8220;no,&#8221; she condemned herself. One of the
assessors, Ma&icirc;tre Jean Lef&egrave;vre, spoke up quickly:</p>
<p>&#8220;That is an unsuitable question for such a girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold your peace,&#8221; cried Cauchon angrily. &#8220;It will be the
better for you.&#8221; And Ma&icirc;tre Jean was silent. &#8220;Answer,&#8221;
commanded the Bishop, turning sternly to Jeanne.</p>
<p>The assembly awaited the reply in a silence so great that a
pin might have been heard to fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I am not in grace, may God bring me thither; if I am,
God keep me there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reply was sublime. The doctors were amazed, and
murmurs were heard among them. &#8220;Jeanne, you say well,&#8221;
came from several. Cauchon was plainly chagrined.</p>
<p>At another time she was asked if she had ever been present
when English blood was shed.</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name, yes. How mildly you talk! Why did
they not leave France and go back to their own country?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon a great English lord cried out: &#8220;She is a brave
girl! If only she were English!&#8221;</p>
<p>These public hearings lasted six days, through long weary
hours, filled with tiresome repetitions, and hidden stratagems
to catch her unawares. But there had been little progress
made, so Cauchon brought them to an abrupt close. It was
high time. As at Poictiers Jeanne&#8217;s compelling personality
was beginning to make itself felt. There was a visible softening
toward her, and one or two of the judges tried to give her
warnings or to aid her by whispered suggestions.</p>
<p>In the streets men were whispering that the judges were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
&#8220;persecuting her out of perverse vengeance, of which they
gave every sign; that she was kept in a secular prison against
the opinion of the court for fear of displeasing the English;
that the English believed that they could have neither glory
nor success while she lived.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was passing through Rouen one Jean de Lohier,
who boldly declared that the trial was not valid. (1) It was
held in a castle, where men were not at liberty to give their
free and full opinions. (2) The honour of the King of France
was impeached; he was a party in the suit, yet he did not appear,
and had no representative. (3) The &#8220;libel,&#8221; or accusation,
had not been given to the Maid, and she had no counsel;
she was a simple girl, tried in deep matters of faith. To
Manchon, the clerk, he said: &#8220;You see how they are going
on! They will catch her in her words, as when she says, &#8216;I
know for certain that I touched the apparitions.&#8217; If she said,
&#8216;so it seemed to me,&#8217; I think no man could condemn her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cauchon was very angry when these words came to him, and
Lohier had to fly the country. It was quite time proceedings
were changed. The Bishop, therefore, chose certain doctors,
saying that he would not &#8220;fatigue all and each of the masters
who at this moment assist us in such great numbers.&#8221; He
told the others that they should be kept informed of the evidence,
which they might study at their leisure, and expressly
forbade them to leave Rouen before the end of the trial. Then
with his chosen henchmen he proceeded to make the inquiry
a private one.</p>
<p>So Jeanne was deprived of even the brief respite which the
change from cell to court afforded. The examinations were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
chiefly repetitions of the interrogations of the public ones,
though both questions and answers were fuller and freer, but
were in consequence fatiguing and more trying.</p>
<p>Asked one day what she meant when she said that Monseigneur
Beauvais put himself in danger by bringing her to trial,
she answered that what she had said to Monseigneur Beauvais
was:</p>
<p>&#8220;You say that you are my judge. I know not whether you
are so; but take care that you judge well, or you will put yourself
in great danger. I warn you, so that if our Lord should
chastise you for it, I may have done my duty in warning you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the danger that may befall him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know not. My Voices have told me that I shall be delivered
by a great victory.&#8221; Her thin face was filled with
sudden radiance. &#8220;It may be that judgment may come upon
him then. And they add: &#8216;Be resigned; have no care for
your martyrdom; you will come in the end to the Kingdom
of Paradise.&#8217; They have told me this simply, absolutely, and
without fail. I do not know if I shall have greater suffering
to bear; for that I refer me to God.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was very plain that the maiden expected to be rescued.
&#8220;Delivered by a great victory&#8221; could mean but one thing to
one so young as she; so day after day she answered their questions
in the manner of one who is waiting expectantly for some
great good to happen.</p>
<p>As the time passed without bringing either rescue, or help
of any sort from her friends Jeanne uttered no word that could
discredit or reproach them. There was never such loyalty as
hers to her King and her party. A monk, Brother Isambard,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
was moved one day to give her some advice about submitting
to the General Council of Basle, the Congregation of the Universal
Church and of Christendom, wherein were men of all
parties. Jeanne heard of it gladly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! If in that place there are any of our side, I am quite
willing to submit to the Council of Basle,&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold your tongue, in the devil&#8217;s name,&#8221; shouted Cauchon
to Isambard. Turning to Manchon, the clerk, he continued
angrily: &#8220;Make no note of that answer.&#8221; But Jeanne protested:</p>
<p>&#8220;You write what is against me, but not what is in my favor.&#8221;
Manchon had already written, &#8220;And she appeals&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He
dared write no more.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Isambard, Brother Guillaume Duval and
Jean de la Fontaine, three men who honestly wished to aid
the Maid, went to the prison to give her further advice, when
Warwick intercepted them.</p>
<p>&#8220;If any of you take the trouble to deliver her and to advise
her for her good, I will have you thrown into the Seine,&#8221; he
told them.</p>
<p>And Brother Isambard thereafter kept silence in fear of his
life, while Brother Duval fled to his convent of St. Jacques, and
appeared no more. The private examinations came to an
end the day before Passion Sunday, and Cauchon called a
meeting of the assessors to consider the evidence and decide
upon further action. D&#8217;Estivet, his secretary, was instructed
to make a digest of the proceedings which should form an
act of accusation to be submitted to the assessors. The Bishop
meantime visited Jeanne, offering his ultimatum:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span></div>
<p>If she consented to wear woman&#8217;s dress, she might hear mass,
as she had so often desired, but not otherwise. To which
Jeanne sorrowfully replied; that she would have done so before
now if she could; but that it was not in her power to do
so. It was for the sake of her womanhood that she retained
man&#8217;s attire.</p>
<p>In Holy Week her troubles began again. Early Tuesday
morning of that week Massieu, the usher of the court, appeared
in the cell, removed her fetters, and conducted her to the room
at the end of the great hall where the court was held before.
All the assessors were present, for Cauchon had sent out a
general summons for them. The case was opened, and
Cauchon made a prefatory speech in which he told her how
merciful were her judges, who had no wish to punish, but
rather to instruct and lead her in the right way. And now,
at this late stage in the proceedings, he offered her the privilege
of having as counsel one or more of the learned doctors present.</p>
<p>Jeanne answered him courteously:</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, concerning my good and our faith, I
thank you and all the company. As for the counsellor you
offer me, I thank you also, but I have no need to depart from
our Lord as my counsellor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thomas de Courcelles, a young doctor of the University,
now began to read the charges against her. The accusations
were mostly frivolous, and some were unjust. It was charged
that she had received no religious training; that she had worn
mandrakes; that she dressed in man&#8217;s attire; that she had bewitched
her banner and her ring (this was the poor little ring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
of base metal which her father and mother had given her so
long before); that she believed her apparitions were saints and
angels; that she had blasphemed; and other charges to the
number of seventy. After each one the young doctor paused
to ask?</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you to say to this article?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Jeanne would reply as she could, referring all her acts
to the judgment of God. It mattered little how she replied;
she was foredoomed by these men. For Jeanne D&#8217;Arc was
guilty of one thing: she had deeply wounded the English pride.
That was her crime. She was a girl, but she had frightened
them, had driven them half the length of France, taken them
in their fortresses, and conquered them in the field. That
was her crime, and it was intolerable. Nothing but burning
her alive could satisfy the vengeance of pride so mortified.</p>
<p>This re-examination took several days, and then Jeanne was
sent back to her cell, but not to peace. While the seventy
articles and the substance of her replies were being reduced to
twelve articles by Cauchon and a few picked men, she was
admonished &#8220;gently and charitably&#8221; in her cell, in order to
lead her back into the way of truth and to a sincere profession
of the faith.</p>
<p>Jeanne fell ill under the strain. Even her magnificent endurance
broke under the burden. She was ill with nausea and
fever, and Warwick sent immediately for several medical men
who were among the judges.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do your best for her,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;My King would on
no account have her die a natural death. He bought her dear,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
and holds her dear, and she shall die by the law, and be
burned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon D&#8217;Estivet, Cauchon&#8217;s secretary, escorted the
leeches to the prison where, weak and in chains, Jeanne lay
upon her bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have eaten a fish that was sent me by the Bishop of
Beauvais,&#8221; she told them when the doctors inquired what
caused the indisposition. &#8220;I doubt not that this is the cause of
my illness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shameful woman,&#8221; shouted D&#8217;Estivet. &#8220;You have
been eating herring, and other unwholesomeness.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0029' id='FNanchor_0029'></a><a href='#Footnote_0029' class='fnanchor'>[29]</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I have not,&#8221; answered Jeanne, summoning all her strength
to have it out with him.</p>
<p>The doctors felt her pulse and found some fever. They
reported to Earl Warwick that she should be bled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Away with your bleeding,&#8221; cried he. &#8220;She is artful, and
might kill herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they bled her and she grew better. As soon
as she was somewhat recovered Cauchon proceeded with his
&#8220;charitable admonitions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have come to bring you consolation in your suffering,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Wise and learned men have scrutinized your answers
concerning the faith which have seemed to them perilous.
But you are only a poor, illiterate woman, and we come to
offer you learned and wise men, watchful and honest, who
will give you, as is their duty, the knowledge which you have
not. Take heed to our words, for if you be obstinate, consulting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
only your own unschooled brain, we must abandon you.
You see to what peril you expose yourself, and it is this we
would avoid for you with all the power of our affection.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you for what you say to me for my good,&#8221; answered
Jeanne wearily. &#8220;It seems to me, seeing how ill I am,
that I am in great danger of death. If it be that God do
His pleasure on me, I ask of you that I may have my confession
and my Saviour also, and that I may be put in holy
ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you desire to have the rites and Sacraments of the
Church,&#8221; said Cauchon, &#8220;you must do as good Catholics ought
to do, and submit to Holy Church.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can say no other thing to you,&#8221; she said, turning from
them. Then they exhorted her powerfully, citing chapter and
verse from the Scriptures, telling her finally that if she would
not obey and submit to the Church she would be abandoned
as a &#8220;Saracen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a good Christian,&#8221; she told them. &#8220;I have been
baptized; I shall die a good Christian. I love God; I serve
Him. I wish to help and sustain the Church with all my
power.&#8221; And that being all they could get from her they left
her for the time being.</p>
<p>The sittings in the room at the end of the great hall of the
castle were resumed on May second, all the assessors being
present. Cauchon summed up all the trial, saying that in spite
of the diligence and gentleness of the doctors their efforts had
produced nothing. It seemed good, therefore, that the woman
should be admonished before them all. Ma&icirc;tre Jean Chatillon,
the lord Archdeacon of Evreux, was invited to make the address
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
whereby he might &#8220;persuade her to leave the criminal
path where she now is and return again to that of truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne listened dutifully to a long preamble by Ma&icirc;tre
Chatillon, and finally bade her admonisher to come to the point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Read your book, and then I will answer,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
refer myself to God, my master in all things. I love Him with
all my heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trial was turning upon the point as to whether she was
willing to submit all her words and deeds to the judgment of
the holy Mother Church.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Church,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I love it, and desire to sustain
it with my whole power, for the sake of our Christian
faith. It is not I who should be hindered from going to church,
and hearing mass.&#8221; As to what she had done for her King
and her country she submitted it all to God, who had sent her.
The question of submission was again asked, and she replied
that she submitted all to God, our Lady, and the saints.</p>
<p>&#8220;And my opinion is,&#8221; she added, &#8220;that God and the Church
are one.&#8221;</p>
<p>To Ma&icirc;tre Jean&#8217;s specific exhortations, touching upon her
submission to the Church, her dress, her visions, and revelations,
she gave her old answers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will say no more,&#8221; she answered briefly with some impatience,
when they urged her further, and threatened her with
the sentence of fire. &#8220;And if I saw the fire, I should say all
that I am saying to you, and naught else.&#8221;</p>
<p>A week later she was led forth from her cell again, but this
time she was taken to the torture chamber of the great tower,
where she found nine of her judges awaiting her, and was once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
more adjured to speak the truth, with the threat of torture
if she remained obdurate. But with the rack and screws before
her, and the executioner ready for his work, she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Truly, if you were to tear me limb from limb, and separate
soul from body, I will tell you nothing more; and if I were
to say anything else, I should always declare that you had
compelled me to do it by force.&#8221;</p>
<p>She told them that she had asked her Voices if, hard pressed
as she was, she should submit to the Church.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you would have God come to your aid, wait on Him
for all your doings,&#8221; was their answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I burn?&#8221; she had asked them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait on our Lord. He will help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Torture was spared that day, as being likely to profit her
little, &#8220;considering her hardness of heart,&#8221; and she was returned
to her cell. Cauchon afterward put the question of
torture to fourteen of his assessors. Two voted for it: Courcelles,
and the spy, Loyseleur, who held that it might be &#8220;a
salutary medicine for her soul.&#8221; The majority, however, were
in favor of mercy, considering that there was enough for her
condemnation without it.</p>
<p>A few days later the decision of the University of Paris,
to whom the twelve articles had been sent, arrived. After
an explanation of the consideration which had been given to
each article, that learned tribunal gave its verdict upon each
indictment; concluding with:</p>
<p>&#8220;If the beforesaid woman, charitably exhorted and admonished
by competent judges, does not return spontaneously to
the Catholic faith, publicly abjure her errors, and give full satisfaction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
to her judges, she is hereby given up to the secular
judge to receive the reward of her deeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>In accordance with this decision the final session of the court
was held on the twenty-third of May in a small room near
Jeanne&#8217;s cell to hear Ma&icirc;tre Pierre Maurice deliver their final
admonition to the captive.</p>
<p>Jeanne listened as always with courtesy to the preacher,
though he was expounding to her all her faults. All this to a
girl who had lived with but one motive: the service of God,
and the deliverance of her country. When he had finished she
was again questioned personally. Her answer was clear and
undaunted:</p>
<p>&#8220;What I have always said in the trial, and held, I wish still
to say and maintain. If I were condemned, if I saw the torch
lighted, the faggots prepared, and the executioner ready to
kindle the fire, and if I myself were in the fire, I would not say
otherwise, and would maintain to the death all that I have
said.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Manchon, the clerk, was so struck by this reply that he
wrote on the margin of his paper: &#8220;Responsio Johannae
superba.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you nothing further to say?&#8221; asked Cauchon of
promoter and prisoner.</p>
<p>&#8220;No;&#8221; was the reply, and he declared the trial concluded.</p>
<p>&#8220;We summon you to-morrow to hear the law which will be
laid down by us, to be carried out afterward and proceeded
with according to law and right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne was led back to her prison and the company of John
Grey&#8217;s men. It was the twenty-third of May, and she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span>
been a prisoner a year. A year, and for nearly five months of
that time she had been chained and ironed like a wild beast.
Through almost four months of it she had been tortured,
badgered, and bullied through the most cruel and unjust trial
the world has ever known. And she had faced this daily torment
with high spirit and undaunted mien. But she was
weary, and worn, and the despondency that follows a period
of high exaltation came upon her. Her Voices had promised
&#8220;deliverance by a great victory,&#8221; and deliverance had not come.
The next day there would be the sentence, and death by fire.
All night the girl lay in her chains striving to commune with
her saintly visitors, but her guards were noisy, and she could
catch but little of what they were saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Answer boldly all that is said to you,&#8221; they told her. &#8220;God
will help you. Fear naught.&#8221;</p>
<p>The morning came, and found her listless, sad, and inexpressibly
weary. The false Loyseleur was on hand early,
urging her to submit to the Church.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do all that you are told, and you may be saved,&#8221; he said
to her. &#8220;Accept the woman&#8217;s dress, and do as I tell you;
then you will be given over to the Church. Otherwise you are
in peril of death.&#8221;</p>
<p>Came also Jean Beaup&egrave;re, one of the assessors.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will soon be led to the scaffold to be preached to,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;If you are a good Christian place all your deeds and
words in the ordering of our Holy Mother Church, and especially
of the ecclesiastical judges.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they talked to her. Presently the cart came that was to
carry her to the cemetery of St. Ouen, which was to be the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
place of her sentence. Loyseleur, Massieu and a number of
the priests rode with her, exhorting, explaining, and pleading
with her to submit. They drove through the marketplace that
she might see the preparations that had been made for the
execution of the sentence should she persist in her obduracy.
Jeanne was not spared one pang. A lofty scaffold with a
stake upon it, the logs all arranged ready for the lighting, stood
in the midst of the marketplace waiting for its victim.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful day in May. The blue sky had not one
cloud to mar its cerulean depths. The streets were filled with
crowds of excited people who pushed and struggled behind
the rows of erect English soldiers who guarded the passage of
the tumbril to the place of sentence: all speaking of life, life
and liberty. And beside Loyseleur was whispering, &#8220;Submit!
Submit!&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the stately church of St. Ouen there was an open
space that afforded room for a large assemblage of people.
Here were erected two platforms, one facing the other. On
one of these, in the midst of prelates and nobles, Cardinal
Winchester sat with the Bishop of Beauvais and the Earl of
Warwick; on the other was the preacher, Ma&icirc;tre Guillaume
Erad, for it was usual to preach to a witch before burning
her. Here also stood Jeanne, and the priests who had accompanied
her. Below and all around were a vast concourse of
people, and many soldiers.</p>
<p>When all were in their places the preacher arose, and began
his sermon: &#8220;A branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it
abide in the vine.&#8221; It was long and eloquent. When it was
half over he suddenly began to apostrophise France and her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
King: &#8220;Ah, France! thou art much abused; thou hast always
been the most Christian of nations, and Charles, who calls himself
thy king and governor, hath joined himself, a heretic and
schismatic, which he is, to the words and deeds of a worthless
woman, defamed and full of dishonour; and not only he but
all the clergy within his jurisdiction and lordship by whom
she hath been examined and not reproved, as she hath said.&#8221;
Then pointing at the Maid, he cried: &#8220;It is to thee, Jeanne,
that I speak. I tell thee that thy king is a heretic and schismatic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne could bear, and had borne much; but she could not
stand an assault upon her King. Clearly her voice rang out
as it had been wont to do on field of battle:</p>
<p>&#8220;By my faith, sire, saving your respect, I swear upon my
life that my King is the most noble Christian of all Christians,
that he is not what you say.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she spoke, defending the craven who had made no effort in
her behalf. There was a sensation among the people as she
made her cry; a stir as though moved in spite of themselves,
and voices began to murmur excitedly. At this the English
soldiers who surrounded the two platforms in a close ring drew
closer, and made threatening gestures toward the crowd which
silenced them. The preacher resumed his sermon, which he
concluded with a last solemn exhortation to the prisoner to
yield submission to the Church.</p>
<p>As her Voices had bade her do, Jeanne replied to the preacher&#8217;s
words boldly: &#8220;I have told you Doctors that all my deeds
and words should be sent to Rome to our Holy Father, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
Pope, to whom, and to God first, I appeal. As for my deeds,
I burden no man with them, neither my King nor any other.
If fault there be, it is my own and no other&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three times she was asked if she was willing to renounce
those of her acts and words which the court condemned. To
which she replied only:</p>
<p>&#8220;I appeal to God, and to our Holy Father, the Pope.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was told that the Pope was too far away, and that the
Ordinaries were judges each in his own diocese, and that it was
necessary that she should confess that the clergy and officers
of the Church had a right to determine in her case. Then the
Bishop began to read her sentence. He had prepared two:
one in case she recanted; the other, the death by fire. It was
this latter that he now began to pronounce. And all around
the maiden there broke forth a tumult of voices urging her to
submit. Some among the crowd dared to call to her entreatingly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Submit, Jeanne, submit. Save yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Almost distracted, the girl folded her hands, and raised her
eyes. &#8220;St. Michael, help,&#8221; she called pleadingly. Her Voices
were speaking, but in the confusion she could not hear, but
about her sounded those others: &#8220;Submit! Submit! Why
will you burn?&#8221;</p>
<p>There is a limit to human endurance. Through months the
girl had preserved a clear mind that had guided her through
the tortuous intricacies of the snares that treacherous legality
and perverted ingenuity could devise for her; she had been
loyal, in despite of all perils, to her belief in her mission, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span>
her faith in her Voices, to her duty to her King: but now&ndash;&ndash;the
indomitable spirit broke under the strain. She could bear no
more.</p>
<p>&#8220;I submit,&#8221; she cried in anguish. &#8220;I am willing to hold all
that the Church ordains, all that you judges shall say and pronounce.
I will obey your orders in everything. Since the
men of the Church decide that my apparitions and revelations
are neither sustainable nor credible, I do not wish to believe
or to sustain them. I yield in everything to you, and to our
Holy Mother Church.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then sign,&#8221; cried a churchman, thrusting forward a paper.
&#8220;Sign, and so abjure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked at him, bewildered and confused by the commotion
about her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Abjure?&#8221; she said. &#8220;What is abjure?&#8221;</p>
<p>Massieu, who had been among those who conducted her
thither, now began to explain. &#8220;Sign,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Sign.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sign,&#8221; cried Erad, the preacher. &#8220;Sign, and you will be
put in charge of the Church.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne could not write, but she mechanically made her mark,
placing it where they told her. Then one of them guiding her
hand, traced the name, Jehanne, at the bottom of the page.
Jeanne gave one last cry as she permitted it:</p>
<p>&#8220;All that I did was done for good, and it was well to do
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Manchon, the clerk, wrote on the margin of his record,
&#8220;And Jeanne in fear of the fire said that she would obey the
Church.&#8221;</p>
<p>This done Cauchon substituted the other sentence:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Seeing that thou hast returned to the bosom of the Church
by the grace of God, and hast revoked and denied all thy errors,
we, the Bishop aforesaid, commit thee to perpetual prison, with
the bread of sorrow and water of anguish, to purge thy soul by
solitary penitence.&#8221;</p>
<p>A tumult arose in the square at this, and stones were thrown
amid cries of disappointment and rage; for the English feared
that they were to be cheated of their prey, and many were
angered that there was to be no burning. In the midst of it,
Jeanne called feverishly to the priests about her:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you people of the Church, lead me to your prison;
let me be no longer in the hands of the English.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the priests left her side, and ran over to Cauchon to
ask where she was to be taken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back whence she came,&#8221; said Cauchon grimly.</p>
<p>Dismayed, miserable beyond words, Jeanne was taken back
to the irons, and the unspeakable torment of her awful cell.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>In the afternoon the Duchess of Bedford sent a tailor to
Jeanne with a woman&#8217;s dress. She put it on without a
word, allowed her hair to be dressed in feminine fashion,
and to be covered by a coif. Courcelles, Loyseleur, Isambard
and other priests also visited her, telling her of the great pity
and mercy of the churchmen, and warning her that should she
return to her errors the Church must abandon her. And so
at last they left her.</p>
<p>Left her to her thoughts and her conscience which now began
to trouble her. For in that moment of recantation Jeanne
had been false to the highest that was in her: the Voice of God
speaking in her heart which was higher than the Church.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I have sinned,&#8221; she cried in anguish. &#8220;I have sinned grievously.&#8221;
And piteously she invoked her Saints.</p>
<p>In the meantime life in that cell was a horror of which it is
well not to think. She was supposed now to be under the
gentle ministrations of the Church, but she was still a captive,
shorn, degraded, hopeless, lacerated by fetters, and weighed
down by heavy chains; for even at night when she lay on
her bed her feet were in irons, with couples fastened to a chain,
and attached by a log to a great beam of wood. Cauchon
had been given to understand that the English would not be
content with &#8220;perpetual imprisonment on bread of anguish
and water of affliction&#8221; for this captive. The girl must burn,
but now this could not be done unless she relapsed. Relapse
she must, willingly or unwillingly. A word to John Grey&#8217;s
varlets would help matters, and the word was given.</p>
<p>It was on Thursday, May twenty-fourth, that Jeanne recanted,
and took the woman&#8217;s dress. On Sunday following she
awoke to find that her feminine attire had been taken from her
while she slept, and on her bed lay the old page&#8217;s suit of black.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sirs,&#8221; she said protestingly in her gentle voice, &#8220;this dress is
forbidden me. Give me the woman&#8217;s dress, I pray you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The guards refused, laughing. Jeanne knew what the end
would be now, but she accepted her fate calmly. The tidings
flew that by this act she had revoked her abjuration. Monday
word was sent to Cauchon and his acolytes, who flocked at
once to the castle. They found the girl overborne with grief,
her face tear-stained and disfigured; the hearts of some of them
were moved to compassion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why have you done this?&#8221; demanded Cauchon.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It is more suitable for me to wear it, being among men,&#8221;
said the Maid, taking the blame of the whole matter. &#8220;I have
resumed it because the promise to me has not been kept; that is
to say, that I should go to mass and should receive my Saviour,
and that I should be taken out of irons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you not promise and swear not to resume the dress
of a man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I am not aware that I took any such oath. I would
rather die than be in irons. But if you will release me from
these irons, and let me go to mass, and lie in gentle prison, I
will be good and do as the Church desires.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since last Thursday have you heard your Voices?&#8221; asked
the Bishop, wishing to find some basis for the charge of &#8220;relapse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes;&#8221; Jeanne&#8217;s sad face brightened at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did they say to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God made known to me by Saint Catherine and Saint
Margaret the great pity there was for the treason to which
I consented by making revocation and abjuration in order to
save my life. I have condemned myself that my life might be
saved. On Thursday my Voices told me to answer that
preacher boldly, and he was a false preacher, who preached.
He accused me of many things that I never did. If I said that
God did not send me, I should condemn myself, for God did
send me. My Voices have told me that I committed sin in
declaring that what I had done was wrong. All that I said and
revoked, I said for fear of the fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Manchon, the clerk, wrote on the margin of his record:
&#8220;Responsio mortifera.&#8221; &#8220;The answer that caused her death.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Do you believe that your Voices are St. Margaret and St.
Catherine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do believe it,&#8221; she cried gladly. &#8220;And I believe
that they come from God. I would rather do penance once
for all; that is to say, in dying, than endure any longer the
misery of a prison. I have done nothing against God and
the faith, in spite of all they have made me revoke. What
was in the schedule of abjuration I did not understand. I did
not intend to revoke anything except according to our Lord&#8217;s
pleasure. If the judges will have me do so, I will resume
woman&#8217;s dress; for the rest, I can do no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was enough. She had relapsed, and the will of her
enemies could now be accomplished. The next day Cauchon
assembled his assessors in the chapel of his house, the palace
of the Archbishop of Rouen. They all agreed that Jeanne
must be handed over to the secular arm of the Church, praying
that it &#8220;might deal gently with her.&#8221; If she showed signs of
sincere penitence, she was to be allowed to receive the sacrament
of confession so long denied to her. Then the Maid was
cited to appear the next morning at eight o&#8217;clock in the Old
Market Place, &#8220;in order that she may be declared relapsed,
excommunicate, and heretic, and that it may be done to her as
is customary in such cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very early on Wednesday morning, May the thirtieth,
Brother Martin Ladvenu went to the cell to tell the Maid of
her approaching death, and &#8220;to lead her to true contrition and
repentance, and also to hear her confession.&#8221;</p>
<p>Terrified and trembling, Jeanne received the announcement
with bitter weeping; her heart failing before the imminence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
of the stake. She was but a girl, and it was a terrible ordeal
that lay before her. What wonder that she wept?</p>
<p>&#8220;Alas!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;will they treat me so horribly and
cruelly, and must my body, which has never been corrupted, be
burned to ashes to-day! Ah! I would far rather be beheaded
seven times than burned. Had I been in the prison of the
Church, to which I submitted, and been guarded by church-folk,
and not by my enemies and adversaries, this would never
have befallen me. Oh, I appeal before God, the great Judge,
against these wrongs that they do me.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the midst of the girl&#8217;s outburst, Cauchon entered the cell.
She turned upon him quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bishop, I die through you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Jeanne, be patient. You die because you have not
kept your promise, but have returned to errors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had put me in the Church&#8217;s prison, and given me
women for keepers, this would not have happened. For this I
summon you before God.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, Jeanne, did not your Voices promise you deliverance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes;&#8221; she admitted sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you must perceive that they are evil and come not
from God. Had this not been true they would not have deceived
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see that I have been deceived,&#8221; she said. They had said,
&#8220;Take all things peacefully: heed not this martyrdom. Thou
shalt come at last into the Kingdom of Paradise.&#8221; They had
spoken also of deliverance by a great victory, but Jeanne misunderstood
the message. So now she said sadly, &#8220;I see that I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span>
have been deceived. But,&#8221; she added, &#8220;be they good spirits or
bad spirits, they really appeared to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now she was allowed to receive the Sacraments, for
this would be proof that the Maid had again recanted. The
sacrament was brought irreverently, without stole or candles, so
that Ladvenu remonstrated indignantly, not being willing to
administer a diminished rite. And at his request the Host
was sent with a train of priests chanting litanies as they went
through the streets with torches burning.</p>
<p>Without the prison in the courtyard, in the streets, everywhere
in the city the people gathered to pray for her, their
hearts touched with pity at her sad fate.</p>
<p>The maiden received the Sacrament with tears and devotion,
the churchmen expounding views and exhorting her during all
the time that it was administered. Pierre Maurice spoke
kindly to her at its close.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Sieur Pierre,&#8221; she said, &#8220;where shall I be to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you not good faith in the Lord?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;God helping me I shall be in Paradise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dressed in the long black robe that the victims of the Inquisition
wore, with a mitre set on her head, bearing the inscription:
&#8220;Heretic, Relapsed, Apostate, Idolater,&#8221; she was
led for the last time out through the corridor and down the
steps to the cart which was waiting to carry her to the place
of doom. Isambard, Massieu, the usher of the court, both
her friends, accompanied her. As the cart, escorted by one
hundred and twenty English men-at-arms, started, a man
pushed his way through them, and flung himself weeping at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span>
Jeanne&#8217;s feet. It was Loyseleur, the spy, who now implored
her pardon. Jeanne forgave him, and the guards, who would
have killed him but for the intervention of Warwick, drove
him away.</p>
<p>The streets, the windows and balconies of the houses, every
place where a foothold could be had, were crowded with people
who wished to get a good view of the Maid on her last
journey. Many secretly sympathised with her, but dared not
show it for fear of their English masters.</p>
<p>Three scaffolds had been erected in the Old Market Place:
one for the high ecclesiastics and the great English lords; one
for the accused and her preacher,&ndash;&ndash;for Jeanne was not allowed
to go to her doom without another exhortation; while in the
middle of the square a wooden platform stood on a mass of
plaster with a great beam rising perpendicularly from it. At
the foot of this innumerable faggots of wood were piled. The
pile was purposely built high so that the executioner could
not shorten her sufferings, as was often done. A placard was
set over the mass of plaster and faggots with the words,
&#8220;Jeanne, self-styled the Maid, liar, mischief-maker, abuser of
the people, diviner, superstitious, blasphemer of God, presumptuous,
false to the faith of Christ, boaster, idolater, cruel, dissolute,
an invoker of devils, apostate, schismatic, heretic.&#8221;</p>
<p>A large number of soldiers ranged around the square keeping
back the turbulent crowd who pressed upon them. Openly
these soldiers rejoiced as the cart that contained the Warrior
Maid was driven into the square. Soon the Witch who had
humbled the pride of England would be done to death. The
victor of Orl&eacute;ans and Patay would ride no more. An humbled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span>
France would soon be prostrate before the might of England.
Jeanne looked on all that sea of faces, some sympathetic, others
openly exultant, with brimming eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rouen! Rouen!&#8221; she cried wonderingly; &#8220;and am I to die
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>A silence fell upon the multitude as the Maid took her place
upon the platform with the preacher, Nicholas Midi, and he
began his sermon from the text. &#8220;If any of the members
suffer, all the other members suffer with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne sat quietly through the sermon, her hands folded in
her lap, praying silently. After a flood of invective the
preacher closed his sermon and bade her, &#8220;Go in peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the words that flung her from the communion of the
Holy Church ended Pierre Cauchon rose, and once more exhorted
her, heaping a shower of abuse upon her helpless head,
and so delivered her to the secular arm of the Church, with the
words:</p>
<p>&#8220;We give you over to the secular power, entreating it to
moderate its sentence and spare you pain of death and mutilation
of limb.&#8221;</p>
<p>A great hush of awe fell upon the people that was broken
presently by a sweet, girlish voice, broken by sobs, as Jeanne
knelt upon the platform, and offered up her last supplication.</p>
<p>She invoked the blessed Trinity, the blessed Virgin Mary,
and all the saints of Paradise. She called pleadingly upon her
own St. Michael for help and to aid her &#8220;in devotion, lamentation,
and true confession of faith.&#8221; Very humbly she begged
forgiveness of all men whether of her party or the other. She
asked the priests present to say a mass for her soul, and all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span>
whom she might have offended to forgive her, and declared
that what she had done, good or bad, she alone was to answer.</p>
<p>And as she knelt, weeping and praying, the entire crowd,
touched to the heart, broke into a burst of weeping and
lamentation. Winchester wept, and the judges wept. Pierre
Cauchon was overwhelmed with emotion. Here and there an
English soldier laughed, and suddenly a hoarse voice cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;You priests, are you going to keep us here all day?&#8221;</p>
<p>Without any formal sentence, the Bailiff of Rouen waved his
hand, saying, &#8220;Away with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne was seized roughly by the soldiers and dragged to
the steps of the stake. There she asked for a cross. One of
the English soldiers who kept the way took a piece of staff,
broke it across his knees in unequal parts, and, binding them
hurriedly together, handed to her. She thanked him brokenly,
took it, and kissing it pressed it against her bosom. She then
prayed Massieu to bring a cross from the church that she might
look upon it through the smoke.</p>
<p>From the church of Saint Saviour a tall cross was brought,
and Brother Isambard held it before her to the end; for she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold it high before me until the moment of death, that the
cross on which God is hanging may be continually before my
eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then bravely as she had climbed the scaling ladders at Orl&eacute;ans
and Jargeau the Maid ascended the steps of the scaffold
to the stake. The good priest, Isambard, accompanied her
with words of consolation. As she was being bound to the
stake she looked her last upon the towers and hills of the fair
city, and again the cry escaped her lips:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Rouen! I greatly fear that you shall suffer for my
death.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cauchon, hoping that now some word of denouncement
against her King might be uttered, came to the foot of the scaffold;
once again she cried to him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Bishop, I die through you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only once did her spirit falter. When the executioner applied
the torch to the faggots, and a dense volume of smoke
rolled up she gasped,</p>
<p>&#8220;Water, holy water!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, in quick forgetfulness of self, for Brother Isambard
still remained with her, though the pitiless flames had already
begun to ascend&ndash;&ndash;she bade him go down lest the fire should
catch his robes. And so at last she was left alone.</p>
<p>Upward leaped the red flames, eager for their prey; upward
curled the dense, suffocating smoke; the air quivered and
whirled with red, stifling heat; and suddenly, from out of that
fiery, awful furnace, there came the clarion tones of the Maid,
clear as on the battle field, exultant with the triumph of a great
victory:</p>
<p>&#8220;My Voices were from God! They have not deceived me!
Jesus! Jesus!&#8221;</p>
<p>And so died the Maid; a martyr, not for religion, but for her
country. She died, but the lesson of her life lives on: faith and
work; for by these two may marvels be wrought and the destiny
of nations changed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The men-at-arms will fight; God will give the victory.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were many signs and wonders told of the execution
after Jeanne&#8217;s death. It was said that a dove was
seen to fly upward toward Heaven at the moment that
her spirit took its flight; that the executioner later in the day
went weeping to Friar Isambard, confessing that he was lost,
for he had burnt a saint; that an English soldier who had sworn
to light a faggot on the pyre had fallen in a swoon as he threw
the burning brand; that her heart, that great heart that beat
only for France, was not consumed by the flame: these and
many other things were told. The truth of the matter was that
even her enemies were not easy in their minds about her death.
There was more than a suspicion that what she had said might
be true: that she was sent from God.</p>
<p>The news of her death swept over France, bringing grief and
consternation to those who loved her, and satisfaction to those
that feared.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385' name='page_385'></a>385</span></div>
<p>In the afternoon of a gracious day in June, some two weeks
after the tragedy at Rouen, two young women might have been
seen coming through the forest down the hill path beyond
Greux from the Chapel of Our Lady of Bermont. It was
Saturday, the Holy Virgin&#8217;s day, and the two had been to
make their orisons at the shrine. But though the Valley of
Colours had never seemed so lovely, so flowery, so fragrant
as it did on this golden afternoon, a young matron and her
maiden companion, the two, walked in silence and with lagging
steps through the tangle of vines and grasses that grew along
the pathway.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is more than two years since Jeanne went away,&#8221; spoke
the younger one suddenly, voicing the name that was in both
their hearts. &#8220;Oh, Mengette, it grieves me to think of her
shut up in a gloomy dungeon when she loved the fields so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Hauviette. And how strange it is that Jeanne D&#8217;Arc,
who was always so good and pious, is up before the Church
charged with heresy. Jeanne a heretic? Pouf! The very
idea of such a thing!&#8221; Mengette laughed scornfully, then
caught her breath with a sob. &#8220;To think of it, when she loves
the Church so. It&#8217;s my belief that those who try her are the
heretics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mengette, if any one should hear you!&#8221; Hauviette cast
a fearful glance about her. &#8220;It would go hard with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I care not who hears me,&#8221; declared Mengette with a toss
of her head. &#8220;Have we not boldly told all who came to Domremy
to inquire concerning her of her goodness and purity?
Ay! even though they were Burgundians or English they were
told the truth though some of them would fain have heard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span>
otherwise. Beside, should any chance to hear me, Robert, my
husband, would not let harm come to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of her sadness Hauviette could not repress a smile.
Mengette had been married two years, and her belief in her
husband&#8217;s all powerfulness had become a proverb in the village.
But the maiden only remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;I would that we could hear how it fares with Jeanne. It
is a long trial.&#8221; She sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Mengette sighed also, and silence fell once more
between them. Long before Domremy had heard that Jeanne
was held in durance, and at length that she was on trial before
the learned men of the University. All feared for the result,
for what chance would a peasant maid stand with such wise
men?</p>
<p>Down the hillside path, through Greux, and on through the
Bois Chesnu went the two friends, until presently they emerged
into the clearing where stood the Fairy Tree in solitary
grandeur. With one accord they paused under its spreading
branches.</p>
<p>&#8220;The commissioners from Rouen were so curious about the
tree,&#8221; commented Mengette, glancing up at it lovingly. &#8220;So
many questions did they ask concerning it, and the Gooseberry
Spring. And, Hauviette, did Isabeau tell you that they
wanted to know whether Jeanne ever carried a mandrake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she told me,&#8221; answered Hauviette. &#8220;As though
Jeanne would do such a thing! Look, Mengette!&#8221; she broke
off suddenly. &#8220;Something has happened, for the people are
running all about the streets of the village.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the most of them are going toward the D&#8217;Arc house,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span>
cried Mengette excitedly. &#8220;There must be news of Jeanne.
Let us hurry, Hauviette.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quickly the intervening space between the forest and the
village was passed, and Jeanne&#8217;s two friends soon entered the
dooryard of the cottage. Colin de Greux left the crowd of
villagers who clustered about the yard talking in low tones, and
came to meet them.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is news,&#8221; he told them in trembling accents. &#8220;It is
all over. Poor Jeanne!&#8221; He paused abruptly, and covered
his face with his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Colin?&#8221; cried Mengette, while Hauviette
grew white, and clasping her hands over her heart stood
waiting the answer with bated breath. &#8220;Is she&ndash;&ndash;is she dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>Colin nodded. &#8220;Burned,&#8221; he said briefly. &#8220;As a heretic
and a sorceress. The Cur&eacute; has just received word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; gasped Mengette. &#8220;It can&#8217;t be true; it can&#8217;t be!&#8221;
But Hauviette could not speak. More than the others had
she loved Jeanne.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; it&#8217;s true,&#8221; affirmed Colin with emotion. &#8220;And to think
that I teased her so. And made her go to Toul, and, and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; His
voice broke.</p>
<p>At this Hauviette recovered herself a little, and laid her
hand softly on his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;She forgave that, Colin, I know,&#8221; she said comfortingly.
&#8220;Jeanne would harbour naught against you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For when she left Domremy for Vaucouleurs
she stopped as she passed through Greux, and said:
&#8216;I go to Vaucouleurs, Colin. God give you good fortune.&#8217;
And He has,&#8221; continued the young man, &#8220;for I have prospered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388' name='page_388'></a>388</span>
beyond any other in the village. &#8217;Tis as though her mere wish
had brought it to pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it did,&#8221; said the maiden gently, finding comfort
for her own grief in consoling him. &#8220;But see! Mengette
has gone to Jacques and Isabeau. Let us go also, that we may
comfort them. Jeanne would like us to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are like her,&#8221; he said, looking up at her suddenly, and
taking the little hand that lay so lightly upon his sleeve. &#8220;You
think of others before yourself. Yes; let us go to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hand in hand they made their way through the sorrowing
people into the cottage. Jacques D&#8217;Arc lay upon the open
cupboard bed, completely prostrated by grief, and Isabeau bent
over him, ministering to him in woe too deep for tears. Beside
them stood the good Cur&eacute;, the tears flowing unrestrainedly
down his cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grieve not,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I believe that the child went straight
into Paradise. I confessed her too often not to know that she
was pure as a lily flower. In Paradise she dwells beyond all
trouble. We who are left behind must not grieve. You have
other children left you. Jean and Pierre are held to ransom,
and they will soon return.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so he tried to comfort them, but for some griefs there
is no consolation. Jacques D&#8217;Arc&#8217;s was one for which there
was no cure. His heart broke under its weight of anguish, and
a few days thereafter he died.</p>
<p>Some time later Pierre and Jean returned to their mother,
and took her with them to Orl&eacute;ans, where she resided the rest
of her long life, the recipient of many honours from the city
that did not forget its Maid. Twenty years later there came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389' name='page_389'></a>389</span>
a day when the long dormant manhood of Charles Seventh was
stirred to action, and he was minded to make amends to the
memory of her who had done so much for him. At his instigation
Isabeau carried her daughter&#8217;s appeal to Rome.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have told your doctors that all my deeds and words should
be sent to Rome to our Holy Father, the Pope, to whom, and
to God first, I appeal,&#8221; Jeanne had cried on the platform at St.
Ouen on the day of her abjuration. She had been told then
that the Pope was too far off; so now Isabeau carried that appeal
to him, asking for justice to be done to her daughter&#8217;s
memory.</p>
<p>The case was reopened, witnesses examined, even some of
the assessors who had sat with Cauchon testifying in her favour,
and Jeanne&#8217;s name was cleared by the Church of every charge
against her. Thankful that her child would no longer rest
under the ban of the Church she loved so well, Isabeau returned
to Orl&eacute;ans, and spent the remainder of her days in peace.</p>
<p>In peace, for at last the land was cleared of the English and
only at Calais had the invader a foothold, and Charles dwelt in
his own capitol at Paris. All of Jeanne&#8217;s prophecies had come
to pass.</p>
<p>Jean, her brother, was made captain of Vaucouleurs when
bluff old Robert de Baudricourt was gathered to his fathers.
Pierre married, and lived with his wife and mother at Orl&eacute;ans.
Both brothers took the name of Du Lys, which the King had
conferred upon them through Jeanne, and were ranked among
the nobility, honoured and revered for the sake of one who
coveted no honour save that of serving her country&ndash;&ndash;plain
Jeanne D&#8217;Arc.</p>
